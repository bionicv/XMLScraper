     Jean Barker I am nervously looking forward to the end of the elections. Nervously because I'm scared Romney will win. Looking forward because my phone number used to belong to someone called "Varoon". I used to just get texts from some guy in Texas who wanted "Varoon" to come and watch porn with him and drink beer. Now I'm instead constantly getting automated calls from interest groups and political parties wanting to survey me. I almost miss the guy from Texas. But luckily, there's a cure for my irritation: Viral election videos. So here they are, along with a quick summary of what they have to teach us about what Americans with a sense of humour are feeling right now: Americans are sick and tired of the elections If you've had enough of the constant squabbling, blatant showmanship and posing of the candidates, and the millions of dollars being spent on making a decision that should not cost the US this much, then you and 4-year old Abigael Evans are on the same page. Abigail broke down after listening to election coverage on NPR on the way to a grocery store. Her  mother filmed her while she wept  and then posted it online. Nice parenting there... "I'm tired... tired of Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney", Abigael blubs. So are we, kid. So are we.    Georgina Guedes This year, Halloween was so nice, we celebrated it twice. Over the weekend, our residents‚Äô association organised a street picnic and trick-or-treating at designated, cobweb-adorned houses in our suburb. And last night we joined up with a group of our friends at the massive Parkview Halloween festival in the George Hay Park.  Everyone got into the spirit of things by wearing fancy costumes and putting on a good show for the local kids. My children enjoyed themselves thoroughly - owing in equal measure to the fancy dress and sweets, and not one but three churning jumping castles in the park.  At our local event, I heard some comments from one of the other mums about a friend of hers who refused to participate in Halloween because it‚Äôs a pagan festival. I also read an article the week before by a mother who feels the same way.  I was surprised by these viewpoints, because as far as I can tell, Halloween is only celebrated as a bit of fun for the kids - and even though it has its pagan roots, no one‚Äôs really worshiping a pagan god or renouncing their own religion by knocking on their neighbour‚Äôs doors dressed as a pumpkin and demanding sweets.  In fact, some pagans I know are quite offended by the commercial nonsense of how the Americans - and now South Africans too - celebrate what they consider to be an important event in their religious calendar.  Those who feel that it‚Äôs somehow wrong to be celebrating a pagan festival should also abstain from buying Easter eggs and maintaining the myth of the Easter bunny, because those rituals have pagan roots.  And as for sending Christmas cards featuring Santa dressed in red with white trim - that tradition has its roots in a Coca-Cola advertising campaign. And Father Christmas himself is a characterisation of a saint - a religious figure that non-Catholic religions don‚Äôt recognise.  I‚Äôm not saying that the religious among us should throw up their hands and admit defeat, but I do think that there‚Äôs no harm in letting children run riot in the neighbourhood streets dressed up as ghouls and witches. This is far removed from any form of pagan worship.  In fact, what I found particularly cheering about the two Halloween shindigs I attended was that it‚Äôs so unrelated to any religion that it unifies a wide range of cultures. My trick-or-treating daughter, bedecked in velvet pointed hat and witch‚Äôs bodice, ran helter-skelter down our streets shoulder-to-shoulder with Muslim, Christian, Jewish, black, brown and white neighbours.  And because no parent in modern South Africa would let their little ones roam freely in the streets, the parents were out in force. I found the whole experience built community spirit and broke down barriers. I was delighted to let my children join in the fun, and I certainly will be doing so next year as well.  - Georgina Guedes is a freelance writer. You can follow  @georginaguedes  on Twitter.   Eusebius McKaiser I feel sorry for middle class South Africans. I really do.  And no doubt many people will be horrified at this empathy for the "haves" in a country with criminal levels of inequality. Millions of South Africans either live in poverty or are worse off than families headed by skilled professionals. Given this context, I am fully prepared for hasty criticism that one's empathy should be spared for the poor. But here is why I think middle class South Africans need a break. Who are they? †††††††††††††††  First, it is, of course, not obvious who counts as "middle class". Policy experts disagree on this classificatory question but suffice to say that teachers, nurses, and corporate sector professionals are all (at the very least) middle class in the context of South Africa. These are the men and women who work very hard to enable their children to not fall a class bracket below the family's bracket, and to increase the chances of their children having a shot at earning and living better than mom and dad. So why do I feel sorry for this economically active lot? Because middle class South Africans are caught between a rock and a hard place: not poor enough to be the object of others' pity, nor rich enough to easily escape the weaknesses of the state. And yet, despite being caught in this horrible spot, it is precisely this crop of skilled professionals and their children that is key to the entrenchment of a deep and enduring democratic culture in South Africa. A democracy without a stable middle class is a permanently fragile democracy. So we cannot afford to ignore the pressures that the middle class face. There is a short-term political gain, however, for leaders to exercise a kind of moral triage, focusing their energies only on the worst off in society.  But we need to also strengthen the middle class, not because we are indifferent to the plight of the poor, but because the fate of both the poor and the middle class depend in part on a stable middle class that has the capacity to help build a job creating economy, and who can be active participants in a deliberative and participatory model of democracy. And yet, right now, we are making it more difficult rather than less difficult for middle class South Africans to play this crucial economic and political role. Carrying extra weight The most recent example of this thoughtless state pressure on the middle class is the "request" of the Gauteng Education Department that schools in the suburbs should accept up to forty learners per classroom. The idea is to optimise the use of resources in better off schools so as to take off pressure from schools that are overcrowded. In effect middle class families must act as a prophylactic against the failures of the state education system. This sounds lofty.  Which middle class bastard will want to openly deny that a poor child has a right to education despite their bad circumstantial luck of being born into a poor family? And which heartless middle class person would openly claim to have no moral duties to care about those drowning in a sea of undemocratic poverty? And given that much of this social injustice is structural and historic in origin how can suburban families pretend that only merit and hard work explain their relative wealth? But here is the snag: middle class families already pay a gigantic proportion of their income in the form of very efficiently collected state taxes. Of course many middle class parents wrongly do not pay school fees when they can afford to. And beyond compulsory taxes we all have at least weak moral duties as individuals to help others worse off than us if we can do so without any real cost to ourselves. The true sin But the true sin here that is not spoken about enough is a political one. A near systematically inefficient, ineffective and corrupt South African state wants citizens who already contribute gigantically to the state's coffers to also bail out an underperforming state. That is grossly unfair. It amounts to class blackmail. Middle class South Africans are made to feel guilty about their relative wealth when the true object of our collective citizenship horror should be the state. The state is not essentially short of funds. So why keep demanding more from the middle class? The state is, however, short of a critical number of morally decent men and women who can properly spend and manage existing resources.  The poor and the middle class should co-operate and collectively hold the state to account for its weaknesses. Class warfare will benefit no one. Meanwhile, politicians and self-appointed elders should give the middle class a break.†  McKaiser is the author of best-selling  A Bantu in my Bathroom .

News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the

Clem Sunter Sandy, the current near-perfect storm engulfing the north-eastern states of America, has quite a few messages which Chantell Ilbury and I have been trying to get across in the three books we have written together on foxes: 1. However powerful you are, there will always be events that are way beyond your control. Your only choice is in terms of the type, quality and swiftness of your response. How many people a month ago would have believed me if I had predicted that the financial centre of the United States - New York - plus a host of other cities in the region would be shut down with empty streets, offices and shops. Foxes take dramatic action when it is required. They do not compromise when so many lives are at stake. They know precisely what they do and do not control. Above all, they recognise a problem when there is one. 2. However good a prophet you are, there will always be "black swan" occurrences that are unknown unknowns i.e things you don't know you don't know until they happen. All you can do is be a foxy script-writer and capture the possibility in very broad terms in an imaginative scenario; then work out a contingency plan and maybe carry out simulation exercises with all the players involved; then act on the plan when the possibility in whatever form materialises. It is much better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong. You will never capture the future exactly. Foxes aim to be vaguely right, knowing that they will make some mistakes along the way which will serve as a learning experience for the next occasion. 3. Wherever possible, you should have a system of flags in place indicating the onset of a particular scenario and its probable evolution. In the case of hurricanes and tsunamis, the work has been done and the necessary sensory devices have been installed. Foxes will continuously upgrade their evaluation of an event using the information as it comes in and adapt their tactics as and when the need arises. Unfortunately in man-made situations like the debt crisis in the Euro-zone countries and in the United States itself, there is no map that can be shown on television indicating the progress of the storm and whether it is waxing or waning. Nevertheless, as best as you can, you have to develop substitute radar systems which can track an economic or political crisis and give you an intuitive feel of its range of consequences. Foxes are known for their bright eyes and quick instincts as regards the rising and falling of the flags. They are ahead of the herd in their response. Americans have a growing respect for Mother Nature, particularly after the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. They are getting better at handling natural disasters and cleaning up afterwards. I wonder whether they realise that the "fiscal cliff" they face at the beginning of new year when national budget cuts are either imposed in a preset formulaic manner or agreed upon in a consensual manner by both houses in Congress poses an even greater danger to the country's future than any natural disaster. If there was a map devised by the economic equivalent of weather forecasters showing the potential extent of the "fiscal cliff", it would cover the entire United States. Superstorm Sandy is a minor event by comparison. Solely relying on The Fed to print extra dollars is not like emptying the streets. Indeed, it could even aggravate the storm! As I said, foxes recognise a problem when there is one. They do not ignore it and behave like it will just go away. They confront it as best they can with the resources they have at their disposal. Send your comments to Clem   Sibongile Mafu Pictures have been dethroned. A number speaks a thousand words.  The  Census 2011 results  were revealed yesterday, third only to election results and crime statistics in terms of numbers fanfare and fascination. This was the third population and housing count in post-apartheid South Africa, and 10 years have passed since the last one. A lot can change in 10 years, and a worrying amount can stay the same. I don‚Äôt know what it is about numbers that make things just a bit starker. Words can embellish and deceive, words can sugar-coat. Numbers, accuracy aside, are stripped and naked, words have a cardigan on. National Planning Minister Trevor Manuel posed the question of what to do with these figures. The standard response of ensuring better and more efficient service delivery to the people of South Africa was ticked. A large number of the 52 million people who live within South Africa's borders are living in  conditions that need serious attention , conditions that have needed attention at every census.  What Census 2011 confirmed, or at least put in percentage form, is that if you're living comfortably, you'll continue to live comfortably, if you're living in abject poverty the government will "look into it" and if you‚Äôre floating somewhere in between, your odds are better if you‚Äôre a man. A lot of work needs to be done Maybe the problem is the Census is seen as an informative tool rather than a challenge to do better. President Jacob Zuma recognised that a lot of work still needed to be done, but more tellingly, chose to put most of his energy into describing the Census as a  "tale of pride" . This surprised me a little bit seeing as the strides that had been made between Census 2001 and Census 2011 were looking more like shuffles. German poet Heinrich Heine once wrote: "You cannot feed the hungry on statistics." Statistics are perhaps a more romantic side of fact. These two cannot be completely separated from one another. Statistics cannot feed the hungry. They're too busy counting how many people need to be fed. It seems to be taking a lot longer than expected. Do we continue being angry at the process or maybe the people we've entrusted with the process? From current statistics and numbers, one can draw predictions as to what future trends will be. In 2061, the average black people will be catching up with what the average white family is earning. I‚Äôll be 63. If you take that into account, the real born frees will be my children‚Äôs children. Yes,  white people still earn significantly more  than everyone else (we use the term ‚Äúearn‚Äù because the English language is so limited) and the number of orphans in South Africa is increasing. Among children under the age of 18, the data shows 3.7% of them are orphans, and 22% are either without a mother or father. I think this has huge bearings on the messages that are sent out about the link between vulnerability and education. Charity begins at home. Learning begins at home. This becomes somewhat tricky when the home is broken or non-existent. Traditional ways of  repairing the education crisis  perhaps cannot be looked at through the view of traditional families anymore when, for many of our young people, that is simply not their reality. A call to action The Census is not a report card, and should probably not be seen as such. It should perhaps be seen as a call to action - a call to do things differently. Take a bit of a risk. That‚Äôs what numbers do. Percentages are provocative. Percentages make one competitive. Percentages make you better. Black people are seeing very little of the pie (chart), let alone getting a piece of it. Many people weren't counted but if you look around, the only thing that can trump numbers is seeing for yourself. The truth of the matter is many of the people living in South Africa are living in conditions that a Census could not begin to comprehend. Things are getting better, but the things that aren‚Äôt, really aren‚Äôt. When the crime statistics are released a wave of shock and horror descends upon the country. When the census results are released, the same bit of horror needs to be observed, since it‚Äôs injustice by another name.

After a few months of bliss and unbridled happiness your partner comes home in a huff, takes one look at your jewels and sniffs accusingly, "it's not very big you know". Choking on your chicken kebab you manage to splutter back an anguished, "I beg your pardon, that's not what you said in the beginning. It's hardly shrunk over time." Reeling, you grasp for all manner of excuses in attempting to justify your perfectly adequate size, remembering those words she once uttered so lovingly - "any bigger and it would get in the way," she said in the beginning, "Of course I don't mind that it's so small, look how cute it is," she assured, or, "it fits perfectly, I wouldn't want it any other way," she once admitted. At the same time, though, you're wondering what brought on the disappointment. Size was never a question before, why does it matter now? Not playing fair Then she blurts out, "well, I saw Adam‚Äôs today, and his is definitely bigger than yours." Ah, the truth. Comparing size with a female friend. And women say size doesn‚Äôt matter. "Pippa can't stop smiling because it's so big. She just grins and grins. At pilates she could barely move. Pippa says that Adam's is bigger than Neil's, Derrin's and Andrew's. She says that Adam's is the biggest of them all." Adam, that little prick. He's trumped us all by waiting this long, unleashing his after we've all shown ours first. That's not playing fair. Chaps, there's nothing you can do, you know. You have a small window when yours is the only one they talk about it. But then someone else comes along and flashes theirs to the world, and you're yesterday's news, chucked on the scrapheap of memories and easily forgotten occasions. You can try and convince your partner otherwise, saying things like, "this will keep you happy for years" or "remember the first time you held it, how good it felt" or perhaps "but your mother loves it". But that doesn't work. When a new, bigger, brighter engagement ring comes around you might as well not be engaged at all, especially if your pals gazump you with rings that appear to come from the private collection of King Solomon‚Äôs mine. Strike out of the blue Gentlemen, if you're thinking about proposing, the moral of the story is simple here: you wait until the final moment, the fifth minute of added time, when your lovely lady is just about in tears at all the proposals proposing around her, and then you strike. Like a lightning bolt from the hammer of Thor itself, you strike out of the blue, and with great fury and purpose you blow the socks of your partner with a ring forged in the fires of the Temple of Doom. That way you look great and your chums, who enjoyed their glory days months before and are now mired down in the suck of wedding-planning details, get looks of longing and inadequacy from partners who immediately start planning their next grand moment... It's a vicious circle of show and tell.  - Follow  @david_moseley  on Twitter . Send your comments to David

Mitt Romney graduated from here. If Salt Lake City's Mormon Tabernacle is the faith's spiritual heart, this is its seat of learning ‚Äì the hot house of its future elite. The campus is as spectacular as it is pristine, with imposing mountains standing over its manicured lawns and autumnal trees. Like many of America's colleges, the facilities are superb: A 64 000 capacity football stadium, a basketball arena that fits another 22 000, a vast library sunk beneath the campus's central square, and an art gallery that would grace many small cities. Thirty thousand students are here, 98% of which are Mormon. Aside from noticing how these days, rather like policemen, students are looking a lot younger, I was struck by a sort of wholesome uniformity.  A clue to this lay in a poster outside the campus bowling alley: "We follow the Honour Code" it said, asking its visitors to "uphold standards of grooming and dress". Surely they have the rest of their lives to worry about that?  Rebellion, non-conformity and experimentation ‚Äì the staples of many university careers elsewhere, don't figure prominently on the BYU menu. The atmosphere was abundantly friendly, welcoming, and above all, very sensible. Everyone looked like they were trying hard to be a grown-up. One of the reasons we had left our Amtrak train in Provo was to gauge opinions on the election. Would these young Mormons all favour Mitt? Would we even find any Democrats? The answers were not entirely what we'd expected.  Lukewarm response to politics It's not about voting for a Mormon, most said. For the majority we chatted to here, it's about values. They were adamant that they're not automatically voting for Mitt ‚Äì although the fact that he hasn't bothered to campaign in Utah tells you how secure this state is.  If the man in the Oval Office shares their values, they'll back him. You could argue that the fact Mitt Romney is an alumnus of their college and a member of their church amounts to the same thing of course. On the whole you would be right. We did manage to find some exceptions though. The Democratic society at BYU has around 250 active members; its president claims he would be proud to see a Mormon elected, just not this one. †He doesn't see how Romney's policies can deliver the kind of caring, inclusive society he wants. He doesn't want to see his religion's stance on issues such as same sex marriage and birth control imposed on all whether they like it or not. Interestingly, he doesn't see that as betraying his faith. Mormonism is not, he contended, about dictating to others, or assimilating them. Aside from an almost complete absence of subculture, the abiding impression we took from BYU was the student body's lukewarm response to politics.  It was the night of the second presidential debate, and after Romney's rout of Obama in the first, followed by the acrimony of the Ryan versus Biden encounter, we thought this next bout would be hotly anticipated by all these first time voters.  Pleasant place to visit A few Democrats were gathering in a dorm room to watch. The Republicans had no specific plans. Some didn't even know it was on. Where was the fire in their hearts? Who here wanted to change the world? Was there really nothing for these students to rage against? From our hotel we wandered out looking for a place to watch the debate, but no restaurants appeared to be showing it. Being a predominantly Mormon town, bars were thin on the ground. We ended up gathering in my hotel room. That night we boarded the train again, with the feeling that we were leaving something of a bubble behind us. Provo's well-funded, immaculately presented, friendly university had made us feel entirely welcome, and I'd genuinely enjoyed meeting the people here. It was certainly a pleasant place to visit; I'm just not sure all of America's electorate would want to live there.

   Andreas Sp√th Nerdy Captonians like myself derive a lot of silly satisfaction from ridiculing assorted European tourists for their countries' botanical inadequacies by pointing out, for example, that there are more different types of plants in the Cape Peninsula than in all of the British Isles combined. It‚Äôs an easy game to play when you live in the Cape Floristic Region. Crammed into the southern corner of Africa, it might be the smallest of the world‚Äôs six floral kingdoms (the others all cover entire continents), but with well over 9000 plant species of which 69% occur nowhere else, it packs a considerable biodiversity punch. But exactly how did this amazing plant variety come about in such a small area? ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù is the obvious answer, but there‚Äôs more to the story. In 1978, the maverick American palaeontologist Robert T Bakker came up with what I‚Äôve always thought of as  a very attractive theory  (you'll have to pay to read it) to explain the astonishing proliferation of so-called angiosperms, or flowering plants. He suggested that dinosaurs had ‚Äúinvented‚Äù them. In the early stages of the dinosaur era, the world was dominated by gymnosperms, a group of plants that includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo trees and Namibia‚Äôs weird Welwitschia. The fossil record shows that by the time the dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago, gymnosperms had been displaced almost everywhere by the angiosperms, of which there are now somewhere between 250 000 and 300 000 distinct species. Bakker argued that flourishing herds of ravenous herbivorous dinosaurs mowed down gymnosperms wherever they could find them and that their intense ground-level feeding habits opened up space and opportunities for the fast-growing and innovative angiosperms to spread and diversify. It‚Äôs a lovely piece of geo-poetry, but alas, it‚Äôs not true.  Research  conducted during the last three decades has shown that there is very little concrete scientific evidence to suggest that a vegetarian dinosaur feeding frenzy had anything to do with the origin or dispersal of the angiosperms. Dinosaurs didn‚Äôt invent flowers... or fynbos. For that, it would seem, we have to look at the opposite end of the zoological size scale.  Scientists  now believe that ants may have played a crucial role in creating the astonishing variety of flowering plants in the Cape. Many fynbos species have developed a little appendage called an elaiosome on their seeds. The only known function of this fleshy structure which is rich in proteins and fats is that it attracts ants who carry the seeds off to their nests where they eat the tasty morsel or feed it to their larvae. The discarded seeds are of no interest to the ants and are buried in the nest‚Äôs waste disposal area, which, because it‚Äôs full of faecal matter and other organic ant refuse, is essentially the equivalent to a fertile compost heap. Here, the fynbos seeds are protected from fires and other critters that might want to eat them, and they have a much improved chance of germinating than elsewhere in the nutrient-poor, sandy soils of this region. It‚Äôs a beautiful example of co-evolution and mutualism, the process in which the interaction between two different species is beneficial for both. Seed dispersal by ants even has its own name: myrmecochory. It leads to genetic isolation by separating seeds from their parent plants, as well as higher survival rates, both of which contribute to increasing diversity. According to Ladislav Mucina and Jonathan Majer of Perth‚Äôs Curtin University of Technology, ‚Äúmyrmecochory may have resulted in a doubling of plant diversification‚Äù among the angiosperms. So what‚Äôs the point of me telling you this little story? It‚Äôs to: a) encourage you to pay some respect to the tireless little workers next time you step on an ant (don‚Äôt worry too much though ‚Äì there are an estimated quadrillion of them alive on earth at any one time); b) show you that evolution isn‚Äôt all about red-in-tooth-and-claw competition ‚Äì cooperation plays an extremely important role; and c) impress on you that we‚Äôre busy destroying biodiversity within decades that it took nature (and countless ants) millions of years to create ‚Äì the Cape Floristic Region is under severe stress from climate change and habitat-loss through human activities. - †Andreas freelance writer with a PhD in geochemistry.

Chris Moerdyk If the world of professional cycling thinks it is going to become good and clean and fresh by making their one-time chief boy scout, Lance Armstrong, look like a complete dope, then frankly, they are bigger dopes than he is. I do not believe for a minute that doping is ever going to be eradicated from sport, not only because it took the cycling bosses more than a decade to cotton on to Armstrong pulling the wool over their eyes but also because they keep adding so much to their list of banned substances that the only way any athlete is going to say cleans in future will be by not eating and drinking anything for two weeks before an event. And who the heck wants to watch a bunch of skeletal wretches on bicycles dying by the roadside halfway up the first hill? I reckon the only way sporting federations are going to be able to maintain consumer interest and bring millions more to the games and watching on TV, is to legalise doping. Seriously. After all, why penalise sportsmen when so many others are making huge names for themselves and bundles of money by quite openly getting themselves doped to the eyeballs. The entertainment industry is a classic case in point. Everyone knows that many legends of the music and the movies took drugs to keep themselves going. It's what got them through punishing concert tours; it's what got them through hours on stage leaping about and singing their hearts out. For many of them, if it wasn't for dope they would not be rich or famous. And did we care? I don't think so. I reckon it is safe to say that the majority of the world's entertainment legends would probably not have become legends had they had a little chemical or liquid help. It would also be naive to assume that cycling is the only sport riddled with a doping problem. Even squeaky clean golf, where everyone is dressed neatly with conservative haircuts and bright, sparkly well-shaved faces, has its culprits who have to get a little help to relax. I was chatting recently to someone who has been on the pro-tour in the USA and he said that drugs were more the norm than the exception particularly among those battling to make a living out of the game. The recent Olympic Games saw a number of athletes kicked out because they tested positive for banned substances. You have to ask yourself in all sincerity whether those were the only ones who were guilty. Especially now that we have found out how Lance Armstrong managed to get away with it so long in a sport that probably has the most rigid checks and balances when it comes to ferreting out doping. And what about business? What about those really wealthy investment bankers, who work 24 hours a day in massively stressful circumstances? You mean to tell me they're just naturally tough? Sure, they might just be talking the odd muscle relaxant, sleeping pill or a bit of prescription happy medication - but all of those things would get them into huge trouble if they were athletes. So, I reckon that if the world is happy to go and watch pop stars and rocks bands who are all killing themselves by the age of 27, then what is the difference between that and watching a doped up athlete shaving three seconds off their world 100 metre record? Whether it's about money or just honour, the playing fields are far from level. Rock stars can do it, film stars can do it, businessmen can do it, just about everyone on earth can do it but sportsmen can't. It's not fair. It's double standards. So either ban everyone from taking dope in the quest for success, honour and money or let everyone do it if they wish.  †††††††  - Follow Chris on† Twitter .   Richard Quest There's no escaping it, when it comes to election time, Colorado picks winners.† Eight of the last ten presidential contests have seen this place back the man who went all the way to the White House. My train journey across some of the US election's pivotal states, for CNN's  American Quest , has taken in Illinois and Iowa, both crucial in their own ways.† But it is Colorado where, on past form at least, the best clue to the victor may be found. This state has everything ‚Äì from IT and healthcare professionals, through to mining and construction workers, via ranchers and snowboarders.† Colorado's relatively flexible economy kept its head just above water in 2008's vicious downturn, and today it is seen as an attractive place to work, live and invest. We arrived at Granby station, two hours from Denver by Amtrak's California Zephyr, to find clear blue skies, open spaces and breathtaking scenery.† Horses galloped across the plains.† The mountains were dusted by the year's first snow.† If you crave the outdoor life, this place is paradise. People move to Colorado from all over the country for its lifestyle, opportunities and easy going nature.† Partly as a result, it is tricky to categorise its people, who span the full gamut from pot-smoking liberals (the state has actually put legalisation of marijuana on the ballot) to camouflage-clad deer hunters.† There is enormous wealth here, as well as grinding poverty.† And when it comes to their political allegiances, as many as 7% of Coloradans are registered Independents. I sat down to chew this over with three of Granby's political elite ‚Äì a Democrat, a Republican, and someone who has voted for both in the past ‚Äì hoping to gain insight into who would carry the state. Brave new world a long way off †Coloradans, I learned, prize their welcoming, inclusive nature.† They like to leave a door unlocked when it's cold, in case someone needs to come in.† They'll offer a ride to those who might need one.† Their values speak as much to the individualism prized by the Republicans as the more social-minded principles of the Democrats. I was told that faith in Obama has been somewhat shaken here.† While people acknowledge the tough task he took on, they feel the brave new world promised in 2008 is still a long way off.† Patience remains, but is in shorter supply.† Likewise, there is a sense that people are beginning to look at Romney more seriously. There was no ringing endorsement of either candidate, which is exactly what you might expect from Colorado; but there was a sense, from all sides, that Romney is definitely becoming more electable. †If that trend continues, Obama must be very careful indeed.† As history tells us, once they think a guy can win it, people are emboldened to get behind him.† And he who takes Colorado, more often than not, takes the Oval Office.

   Simon Williamson The much-lauded practice of the US presidential debates achieves very little in terms of working out who would make a better president.  Held within a month of the election, their only purpose from a voting point of view is that the same messages that the candidates have been espousing for years (or in Republican candidate Mitt Romney's case, days) reach more ears.  The audiences for the debates ranged from a peak of over 70-million people to a low of 59-million ‚Äì in a country with an electorate of around 150-million, that is enormous. † But while daily tracking polls and snap polls (the equivalent of asking you what you think of a piece of food before you have finished swallowing) showed a swing towards Romney after the first debate, and a stagnation in that due to better performances by incumbents Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama in the following three, no candidate was tested by the things that actually make a difference when one occupies the Oval Office. Being commander-in-chief isn't all about showmanship. † Incidentally, while many South Africans seemed enthusiastic about a series of debates between Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille and President Jacob Zuma last week (as is Zille's wont when these debates occur in other parts of the world), can you imagine fitting a discussion about the Youth Wage Subsidy or the echelon of hell in which the mining industry finds itself into two minutes per candidate with one-minute rebuttals?  This is aside from the fact that South Africa's system of representation means the rules would likely have to include members of all parties represented in Parliament (which would mean two minutes from 13 candidates ‚Äì 26 minutes ‚Äì if we took the minimum polling barrier (400 seats=0.25%) that would permit parliamentary representation as results of the 2009 election reflect. The USA's barrier is (somewhat unfairly) 15% required in polling. The parties would also need to nominate presidential candidates before the debates.)  Bite-sized chunks of entertainment Obama and Romney had to fit in complicated discussions about troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, how to deal with the Chinese impact on the American economy, job creation, trickle-down economics, healthcare, welfare and financial reform, states' rights, federal funding to women's organisations, terrorist attacks which killed US diplomatic staff in Libya and where the blame should go ‚Äì all in 15-minute segments. SuperSport takes longer than that to go over a Currie Cup rugby match.  In fact, if anyone can fit their initial explanation of how to reform the healthcare sector to control costs while promoting coverage into the amount of time it takes to brush your teeth, I doubt its validity. In the time it takes to make microwave popcorn, we expect candidates to explain how to resurrect US manufacturing and other small businesses using the tax code and incentives. Pah! † The debates attempt to turn policy into bite-sized chunks of entertainment during prime time, which proper policy considerations are anything but.  Republican presidential candidate and former speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich said during his failed run that if he won the nomination, he would invite Obama to three three-hour "Lincoln-Douglas" style debates (modelled on the 1858 run-up to the US election between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas) which sound about as interesting as a beige bucket full of ditchwater being poured on the letters I don't read from my insurance company.  The two men would go in-depth with a few issues, rather than playing 90-minute  Who Wants to be a Millionaire  and hardly anyone would watch the whole thing. Quite frankly, if we're all as into listening to policy talk as we think, and don't want it packaged into the equivalent of finger foods, we'd constantly be watching the Parliamentary Channel (or in America C-SPAN).  No value for voters The "winners" of the debates are also declared via incredibly shaky criteria. No one was in any doubt Romney won the first debate against Obama, but did so speaking some nonsense convincingly.  If you read the transcript, Obama made some solid policy arguments, but his flat tone and umming and aahing was steamrolled by Romney's energetic and superbly prepared performance.  In principle, these debates are not for candidates to win a Golden Globe (or handshake), but to allow voters to choose based on what policies they plan to implement during their presidency. Yet the terms prevent in-depth policy discussion, and the winner is often declared on style or partisanship.  † There's no denying debates can prove useful. But under current rules agreed upon by the contestants, the criteria that determines who "wins" and the fact that there really isn't enough time or opportunity to discuss anything in depth, there is incredible room for improvement.  † As things stand, there is value for the contestants, but not for voters.†   -  Simon Williamson  is a freelance writer. Send your comments to Simon   Clem Sunter Since writing  the column  two weeks ago raising the probability of South Africa becoming a Failed State to 25%, many people have asked me what it means and what they should do about it. Should I make sure my passport is up to date? Should I be going on an LSD (look, see, decide) trip to Australia? Should I be approaching a head hunter for job options in Europe? Should I legitimately be sending more money offshore to mitigate the declining rand?  Should I be stocking food? Connecting the dots These are all valid questions which have been posed to me. Chantell Ilbury and I have always said that part of thinking like a fox is to connect the dots. You cannot just play scenarios ‚Äì that‚Äôs daydreaming. You have to consider your options for each scenario and then decide what you are going to do about it depending on the probability and impact of the scenario. You can either do something now or prepare a contingency plan just in case. Either way, the whole point of the process is to improve the speed and quality of your response in chasing the opportunities and countering the threats offered by the scenarios. So, let‚Äôs get back to the significance of a 25% probability. Pictorially, it covers an ‚ÄúL‚Äù or 90 degrees of a circular disc. If you spin the disc, there is a 25% probability that the needle will end up on that 90 degree segment. What is more is that if you spin it again whatever the previous result, the probability is still 25%. Like spinning a coin where you get ten heads in a row, the chances are still 50:50 that the next one will be a head. The difference between these examples and real life is that real life only happens once and therefore probabilities are far more subjective. Recently, I had a discussion with a group from MIT in the US who tried to convince me that you can mathematically link the raising of the flags on our scenarios to their probabilities. I am not so sure because of the one time aspect of life; and so much of what happens is due to the animal spirits or irrational nature of mankind. The bottom line is that the 25% probability on a Failed State is instinctive and should be treated as such. In other words, there is nothing scientific about it and if you have a different figure in† mind, you are quite entitled to base your actions on your figure not ours. Suffice it to say, in our mind, the Failed State scenario is no longer a wild card possibility lurking in the shadows: it is now a genuine threat, the consequences of which have to be thought through. Impact of the scenario on you This brings us to the second aspect that has to be considered which is the impact of the scenario on you as a business, you as a family or you as a person. If I said to you that the plane you had booked a flight on had a 25% probability of crashing, you almost certainly would not take it unless you were in a war zone and wanted to escape. The reason is a high likelihood of death in the event that the scenario materialises. Equally, if I gave you a 25% probability of being eaten by a shark when swimming off a particular beach, it would be very foolhardy of you to go in the water. One of the reasons you would not take the risk in either case is that the alternative options are usually easy to exercise: use another airline and go to another beach or swimming pool. The impact of a Failed State scenario is far more difficult to imagine since so many varieties of a failed state exist, ranging from oppressive dictatorships through perpetual anarchy to civil war and at the extreme end genocide. No expert in the field here has adequately described the different forms that a failed state in South Africa could take. We certainly can‚Äôt, particularly as regards timing and rate of descent.  The only thing we can state with confidence is that the rest of the world will collectively turn its back on us, apart from a few outcasts who will welcome us to the club of pariah nations. Two categories of options Hence, the evaluation of the overall risk of this worst case scenario i.e. probability times impact is a highly personal thing. And so too is the selection of options available which depends on individual circumstances such as age, level of wealth and education, business experience and skills, as well as the number of children and other family commitments you have in South Africa. In the case of a business, the opportunity to expand the geographical footprint outside South Africa will be linked to its range of products and services, health of its balance sheet and potential partners elsewhere. However, options can be divided broadly into two categories: adapting your own strategies and tactics as regards your own future in light of the changing odds of the scenario; or rolling up your sleeves and taking action ‚Äì however big or small it may be ‚Äì to reduce the odds of the scenario itself. In other words, you become an active citizen in ensuring that South Africa does not fail. Far be it from Chantell and myself to give you specific advice on which option you should take. What our 25% probability means is that you should give the matter some serious thought if you have not done so already. Then decide on appropriate action or have a contingency plan. That is what a fox would do ‚Äì logically not fearfully, with a sense of purpose not despair. Send your comments to Clem   Sibonglie Mafu When Eskom proposes, there is no ring. There are no fireworks. There isn‚Äôt even a sunset. There may be a candlelit dinner since that requires very little power. When Eskom proposes something it‚Äôs usually quite a dim affair.  Their latest proposal has been their most depressing piece of news since the Mass Rolling Blackouts of 2008. Those still give me nightmares. Eskom‚Äôs latest tariff application sees them asking the National Energy Regulator of South Africa to approve hikes that would increase the cost of electricity by 16 percent a year for the next five years. This effectively means we‚Äôd be paying almost double what we‚Äôre paying now, in five years. This means those measly units that you‚Äôre able to scrape together each month will double in cost.  Eskom is seriously standing in the way of my sanity.†  Power from magic and rainbows   I‚Äôve had a love/hate relationship with Africa‚Äôs largest producer of electricity for most of my life. Eskom makes for very good small talk content, second only to the weather. In the good old days when I was a little kid and my parents paid for my electricity consumption, I thought power came from magic and rainbows. Like babies. The energy that made my beverages warm and kept my drinks cool was as free as the sunset, and brought just as much joy. As the years went on, I started to see the cost of having power in your home was a real one. I realised that businesses and industries needed it to exist, and to keep the country going. Even when I went to my local salon to get my hair relaxed when I was younger, I realised the sheer amount of electricity that was being used by my hairstylist just to keep her hairdryers on and water warm. My parents have a prepaid electricity meter and when I became old enough to count, they would send me off to buy electricity at our local garage. They‚Äôd give me a neat R50 note and a card, put it in a bank bag and tell me we‚Äôre in the red zone and in desperate need of power. And then off I'd go to get us back in the green zone - the zone that made the television run and life better. I‚Äôd sometimes stand in a queue that would stretch right around that garage, behind people on the same mission as me. Some were only armed with a R10 note that would be just enough to cook something for their families that night. Who knew about tomorrow? This was ten years ago. I‚Äôd return home with my hard-earned power which my mom would insert into the meter, getting us comfortably out of the red zone. I‚Äôd then continue living my life, using up energy until the next time I was asked to top up. Even the TV tells us... Ten years ago there were hardly any notices on my television asking me to switch off any unnecessary appliances and threatening red flashing lights that said South Africa, at that current time, was consuming too much power. Yes, my mom always told me to switch off the lights when I left a room and not use too much hot water, but then the TV started telling me this, so it had to be true! I had to adapt. Soon after that I started learning about Eskom‚Äôs reliance on coal and the need for renewable energy and I began to realise that comfort came at a cost.  With these proposed new tariff hikes, it won‚Äôt get any easier. With everything from the price of fuel to the price of food going up, it‚Äôs turning out to be quite an expense to be alive. Has anyone ever emigrated due to ill-treatment by Eskom? France looks nice. † - Sibongile is a videographer, blogger and social media enthusiast who would be nothing without her thumbs.

While on routine patrols guarding against displays of excessive whiteness at Rondebosch Common, Constantia Village and Cavendish Square shopping centres, ANC ‚Äúspooks‚Äù were called to witness a worrying scene inside Cape Town‚Äôs CBD. Alerted by sharp-eyed citizens, the ANC spies arrived in the city centre to confirm their party‚Äôs worst nightmare: hordes of white Germans and Dutch cruising Long Street, subtly invading the province.  Second coming Now, hot on the heels of the South African spy network uncovering the British government and Helen Zille‚Äôs coup plot to unseat the ruling party by flooding the country with football hooligans and extreme amounts of vinegary fish and chips at election time, the ANC will have to contend with the second coming of pale-skinned Europeans intent on whisking away African ladies in the middle of the night. A senior government official, who is also the CEO of a gold mine, an MD of a large financial institution, the owner of a newspaper group and a Sunday school ethics teacher, has said that the government is now monitoring the movements of German and Dutch visitors to South Africa who, for some unfathomable reason, have congregated en masse in the Tamboerskloof area of the city.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who they are, we don‚Äôt know what they want,‚Äù said the high-ranking revolutionary struggle comrade youth, ‚Äúbut we have a very particular set of skills. And we will find them, and find out what they want with our mines, our women and our township tours.‚Äù The invasion Worried government spies have pointed to Helen Zille‚Äôs surname as a sign that a second Dutch invasion is imminent. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious with a surname like ‚ÄòZille‚Äô that the Western Cape Premier has no interest in local South Africans,‚Äù said the government official. ‚ÄúWe also know Premier Zille and Angela Merkel tweet each other about the latest power-dressing fashions and share the same awful hair-dresser. This has to stop.‚Äù When asked for comment Zille, suspiciously wiping what appeared to be sauerkraut and pretzel crumbs off her chin, said she was unavailable as she was too busy trying to escort Tony Ehrenreich, who has been camping on her front lawn for the last two weeks, off her property. When asked why she was taking out the trash in lederhosen, the Premier sniffed, ‚ÄúI find them comfortable‚Ä‚Äù Mr Ehrenriech, however, was quick to offer an opinion when no one asked him. ‚ÄúYou know, first theses foreigners will move into Tamboerskloof, but before you know it they‚Äôll be living in Constantia and all around the Rondebsoch Common. It‚Äôs not fair. I saw it first,‚Äù said a clearly distraught Ehrenreich.  For the love of SA When pressed on the matter of the white invasion and a possible government takeover by British, German and Dutch forces, Ehrenreich continued, ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs worse? Have you seen who‚Äôs slipped back into the country ‚Äì Tony Leon! That oke! He‚Äôs probably bringing in half the population of Argentina as we speak. Though I guess they‚Äôre not really white. What colour would you call them? I‚Äôm not sure. But one thing‚Äôs for certain, Tony Leon, in those dapper suits and intellectual musings, means trouble!‚Äù Dutch political analyst Claude van der Clog-en-Dyke hinted that his countrymen love South Africa because the weed was better than Amsterdam‚Äôs, and that factor alone could account for the high numbers of Dutch people in South Africa. When asked to comment on the accusations of Germany annexing the Cape from the rest of South Africa, a German official simply asked, ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù President Zuma is said to be unconcerned about the matter, but is said to be pondering out loud the possibility of adding a voluptuous German maiden to his harem of wives.  Meanwhile, in Britain, Boris Johnson has announced his intention to run for mayor of Bishop‚Äôs Court should his bid for Prime Minister of Britain fall through. Manufacturers of combs in the area are said to be gravely concerned. † - Follow  @david_moseley  on Twitter . Send your comments to David

News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24 .   Chris Moerdyk When you think about it - everything that is happening in South Africa today is pretty much like a hormone-charged teenager who thinks he knows more than any adult and puts partying, money, big brands, self-adulation and materialism above all else.  And pretty much doesn't give a stuff about what‚Äôs going to happen in† the future.  Birth and formative years It all started in 1994 when the South African democracy was born.  The new baby had a father figure who was consided the world over to be a saint, a statesman and a true leader. As the child grew up, this awesome parent gave him all sorts of things of which to to be proud. The kid flew the country‚Äôs flag with pride and everything was rainbows, prosperity and really nice warm feelings.  By the time the youngster turned 10 his hero had long been replaced by another father figure. A bit of a dreamer who didn‚Äôt really have much time to devote to setting good examples. While his predecessor took time to teach tolerance, dialogue and just about every other admirable parental trait imaginable, this new father figure spent a lot of time away from home and did some really silly things like becoming a notorious Aids denialist.  He also quite openly seemed to spend much more time protecting his brothers and sisters rather than looking after the kids.  Impressionable years Then just as the young fellow entered his most impressionable years an uncle arrived and had a hell of dig dong figit with the father figure who, a few year earlier had thrown him out of the house. The tables were turned an the uncle took over the house. † The impressionable teenager was patronised but mostly ignored.† His uncle was not a great listener. † So,† there he was left pretty much alone in the wilderness, his dreams shattered and the rainbows and wonderful warm feelings of his childhood days a distant memory .  He watched his uncle and his brothers and sisters accumulating wealth right left and centre without even glancing in his direction as he tried to make sense of the waves of crime that washed over him as a desperate and increasingly dysfunctional society mercilessly mugged him at the drop of a hat.  Grown up and wide-eyed This year he turned 18. Gaunt, wracked by poverty and crime with nowhere to turn. His father figure and all of those who moved into the house his father Nelson had built, didn‚Äôt seem to give a damn. They just kept surrounding themselves with more and more security, blue light brigades, multi-million Rand security upgrades to their increasingl bomb- proof homes and utter disdain for anyone who was† not a member of the inner circle.  This 18 year old adolescent is fast losing hope. He sees his peers and elders taking to flaunting the law, destroying property and killing people in an effort, they tell him, to earn a living wage.  He watches wide-eyed as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  Scared Right now South Africa is a scared, undernourished, pimply adolescent who has not the foggiest idea of what the future holds.  Right now, this troubled teenager doesn‚Äôt know whether to just forget about everything his very first father taught him about morality, respect, non-racialism and serving one‚Äôs fellow man and simply try to emulate either his present father figure or just join the growing hordes of youngsters who have decided that human life has no value and that if you kill enough people your demands will be met.  Or, of course, go into politics, choose the right party and climb aboard the fun-filled, cadre-deployed, gravy train.  One has to wonder what will happen to this this pimply teenager as he becomes a young adult and then reaches middle age. Will he eventually be able to control his raging hormones and start thinking rationally? Will he remember was he was taught as a child?  Or, will he grow old surrounded by anarchy and poverty and survive as best he can and leave nationa-building to another generation? †††††††  - Follow Chris on† Twitter .   Jean Barker My personal nickname for Facebook is "Fightbook", because every time I dare voice a political opinion there I find myself being accused of whatever character flaw offended Israelist, Islamist, Romneyist, or anti-feminist, xenophobic right-wingers of various persuasions feel they have discovered in me.  I'm tired of the fight. Too tired to bother most of the time. Yet I very nearly snapped and waded back in for another useless round recently, when a sorority girl whose parents own a double storey house in a wealthy suburb near LA and who has access to her mom's credit card for emergency dress shopping posted one of those "Goodbye Obama" graphics. At the top, it featured a picture of Obama styled to look like the monkey kid from MAD magazine circa 1980s. And then the text: "If you can afford beer, drugs, cigarettes, manicures and tattoos, you don't need food stamps or welfare." Voters love dumbasses You see, politicians here in USA say the dumb shit they say for the same reasons Mr JuJu says the dumb shit he says in South Africa: There are a lot of people who secretly or openly want to hear stupid things said. There are people who agree with the right-wingers' take on rape, women's health (whether in binders or out), homosexuality and Israel/Palestine. Americans, although kind and sweet, are deeply right-wing when it comes to financial matters. Romney said this about poor people, yet is still neck and neck with Obama in the polls: "...there are 47% who are [...] dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. ... My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." And there's plenty more  high and mighty nonsense  where that came from. These comments about lower income Americans were made at a private fundraising event where Romney was asking richer people than himself for money (spot the irony!) to fund his presidential campaign. He has somehow - with the help of media such as Fox News and the culture of fear that makes it impossible to have a peaceful political discussion at a party here - managed to persuade Americans still vulnerable to McCarthyist tactics, that Obama is the rooi gevaar (that's Afrikaans for "communist threat"). Richer Americans, like many wealthy South Africans, tend to take the stance that poverty is a result of some kind of wrong-doing on the part of poor people, and that what they need is tough love. Safety net They believe that it's just fine for rich people to spend a fortune on fine wine, jewels, country clubs and other luxuries (because that's "their money to spend as they wish") but it's wrong for a poor person to drown their much more real sorrows, or pay for tattoos, or a cheap manicure. Presumably, poor people don't have the right to anything but the bare necessities. Even their little share of money is not their money to spend how they choose. The poor's moral weakness for drugs, moonshine and other ‚Äúluxuries" is somehow much less pure than the elite's need for jewels, sorority ballgowns, private educations, fine wines, foreign travel, presidential campaigns and other enriching experiences! Give me a bloody break, Mittins on uR-Money. Here's what I think: rich conservatives stand in judgement because they need to condemn others to feel better about their good fortune. They want to believe that poverty could never have happened to them because they're somehow nobler and better, and not because their families and educations are their inherited safety net. They're implying that the poor brought their suffering on themselves by being lazy, while rich people got rich off the sweat of their brows, and not through the use of cheap labour. I'm not saying some wealthy people didn't work hard not to squander the opportunities they were given. That doesn't make them any less lucky to have had those opportunities in the first place. It doesn't give them the right to treat the less fortunate like children in need of a lesson.

Clem Sunter  I have just read the following paragraph on  News24 : "Zuma also called on senior officers in business and government to freeze salary increases and bonuses for the next year as a 'strong commitment to build an equitable economy'." I totally support the sentiment, but the president has to be the first in line by announcing what sacrifices he is personally going to make in order to get the show on the road. Genuine leadership is about action , not words. I wrote the following in an article after Warren Buffet called for the US government to get serious about  shared sacrifice : "Coincidentally, I have been saying the same for some time that Barack Obama should be leading from the front by taking a pay cut himself. He should insist that members of Congress do the same." For a start, I find it amazing how many members of government are allowed to travel business class on SAA. The other day, I remember seeing a prominent SACP individual in business class on his way to Cape Town when just on the other side of the curtain in economy sat the ambassador of one of those western capitalistic nations he so often derides. The ambassador told me that budgetary considerations now meant that all his diplomatic staff had to travel in the back of the plane. As for hotels, the appalling stories in the press of senior government officials booking penthouse suites in the best hotels in London, New York and everywhere in South Africa make you wonder how such extravagance can be tolerated in these economic hard times. Sometimes the rooms are not even used. Ordinary folks now stay in budget hotels or bed and breakfasts to cut down the cost of travel. Moreover, this belief that there is an endless stream of taxpayers' money swelling state coffers extends to flashy cars and bodyguards. Why is it that even at provincial and local government level senior employees are allowed to drive top-of-the-line models? I drive a 10-year-old Mini on trips around town and a Land Rover Discovery with the wheel on the back if I am going on holiday. Blue light convoys and bodyguards are yet another example of total excess. Please give me one other country in the world where the leader of the ruling party's youth wing travels around in a convoy with a troop of bodyguards. Not even in Russia. Is South Africa so spectacularly dangerous that every single minister and every single senior party official has to be afforded the level of personal protection that they are given? I remember in Anglo American that the only person who had a bodyguard was Harry Oppenheimer, who successfully evaded him when he wanted to walk by himself to the barber in Commissioner Street. We can widen the list of items to be trimmed to residences, conferences, overseas trips, the quality of whisky, you name it. The fact is that for a party that espouses left-wing ideology and calls for measures to narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots, there is an Orwellian contradiction between the sacrifices being demanded of others and the sacrifices being made by the party itself. "Some people are more equal than others" is the perception held by many members of the public. Nevertheless, I shall heed the President's call. I solemnly promise that I will not put up my fees for my speaking engagements in 2013. Now I want to know what you are going to do, Mr President. Send your comments to Clem   Eusebius McKaiser While Lance Armstrong, former international cycling superstar, has not owned up to doping allegations, the evidence has become too compelling to continue denying. This raises a difficult question: is he simply an immoral cheat? Or is he also a symptom - perhaps even a victim - of unhealthy American can-do-ism? Armstrong, it would seem, represents the best and worst of American competitiveness.  I have met and befriended a number of brilliant young Americans, many of them international Rhodes Scholars studying at Oxford University. Many have shopping lists of exceptional CV achievements that make most other students feel like impostors. It is not surprising that one of them might have been a concert pianist during high school already, and that this is a measly extramural achievement, competing with several international languages they have learnt, internships completed at the White House perhaps, and of course a few "summers abroad" spent building houses in war torn African villages or a few clinics in Aids-ravaged South Africa, in between a stint in the Navy.  What lies beneath They look the part, move around comfortably at cocktail parties with an enviable ability to work the room, sounding intimidatingly confident as they rehearse a future life of prominent public leadership.  And yet, for all this appearance of controlled achievement and brilliance, there is lots of anxiety that lurks beneath. Being the curious creature that I am, I often put pressure on some of these acquaintanceships, having little time for relationships based on pretense. And what I sometimes found exposed an American culture of extreme competitiveness that breeds dysfunctional young adults who simply learn how to mask their demons. It is therefore unsurprising to me that in that context  Lance Armstrong  can both emerge as an exceptional hero and a pathetic cheat.  Of course we should not let a cheat off the hook. Lance Armstrong is not a robot. He has the intellectual capacity and free will to decide what to do and what not to do. But it is important to situate Armstrong's cheating within an American culture that makes such cheating unsurprising. America, especially middle class America, has some soul searching to do.  The tragedy of competitiveness in overdrive Armstrong was already a professional triathlete at the age of 16. He immediately started raking in achievements nationally and internationally, and became so used to the high of winning that a first crack at retirement was bound to fail. With so much natural aptitude on early display, it is particularly tragic that doping allegations should be so compelling. One can't help but wonder if Armstrong could not have achieved the same outcomes with only the biological resources he was gifted from Mother Nature?  But  the tragedy here  is worse: claims by fellow athletes that they too took drugs are further evidence of American competitiveness in overdrive. The pressure to succeed in the United States is so extreme that personal integrity can easily be squandered for apparent success. It's certainly not an excuse (there are counter-examples, after all, of men and women with integrities intact), but it is a reason to reflect on whether programmatic childhoods aimed at mopping up only the best possible awards at school and in life generally, is healthy.  American kids, especially those in middle class families, experience too much pressure. (This is true even if one also, of course, notes that doping scandals happen in places like China too. Their cultural origins in American society are distinct. In places like China it is often driven by politics, including geopolitical warfare through sporting activity.) One of my contemporaries, New York Times bestselling author, Jonah Lehrer, is a literary example of this madness. An enviably gifted writer with a background in neuroscience, he cut a calm, reflective, deeply intelligent and handsome figure at Oxford University. Before the age of 30 he had attained national fame, and was bound to be one of the best science writers of his generation. Now his  career is in tatters . He made up, and falsely attributed, quotes to Bob Dylan in his recent book (un)ironically entitled  Imagine: how creativity works .  And yet Lehrer's early work ‚Äì not grounded in academic cheating ‚Äì is so brilliant that one again wonders why someone would not be content with their natural endowment? Is Lehrer, like Armstrong, simply an immoral cheat? It is tempting to say "yes" but that would be an incomplete answer. The truth is that when you are surrounded by other brilliant people all your life and desperate to prove that you can be first among equals, then taking short cuts become unsurprising, even if doing so is inexcusable.  This is not to suggest that Armstrong ‚Äì or a Jonah Lehrer ‚Äì should be pitied. It is also not to deny their agency. They are fully responsible for their actions. But human beings do not exist in a vacuum. We exist in family structures, local communities and societies-at-large. And, in my experience, there are too many other stories I could share of brilliant Americans like Armstrong who seem to have needlessly faltered.  And this seems to beg the question: Is American society blameless in the making of cheats like Armstrong? I think not. Indicting society is, let‚Äôs not forget, compatible with holding cheats individually accountable for dropping the ball ‚Äì or injecting the needle, as the case might be. † McKaiser is author of the bestselling ‚ÄòA Bantu in my Bathroom‚Äô.

Georgina Guedes One time, in Portugal, two friends and I let the novelty of Absinthe go to our heads, and when we got back to where we were staying, we carried on the party by taking a couple of topless photos of ourselves.  Embarrassingly, this was in the days of film cameras (she said, clutching her walking cane), so in order to retrieve our holiday photos, we had to have the whole spool developed. Being of sober minds at that point (although our hangovers stretched on for weeks), we destroyed the offending photos, and that was the end of that. Unfortunately, this is not the way that many ‚Äì way too many ‚Äì nudie photo stories end. The world is full of stupid or vindictive idiots, and anyone who puts out in public those bits that they would prefer remained private, is risking their vajayjay going viral.  Life's lessons There are lots of lessons I hope to share with my daughter as she navigates her way along the winding road of life. They start with ‚Äúalways wear sunscreen‚Äù, and don't really have an end, but stop at ‚Äúdon't stay with cruel men‚Äù, and ‚Äúbe loyal to your friends‚Äù, along the way. A very important destination along the route will be, ‚Äúdon't give naked photos of yourself to anyone‚Äù. People seem to do this in two different scenarios, broadly speaking. The first one is when they believe that there is a level of trust between them and the recipient. The teenage girl misses her boyfriend so much that she sends him a photo of her boobs to prove it.  It's all sweet and naughty, but then they break up, and when she hook up with someone else, her ex is so consumed with jealousy that he puts a photo of her boobs on the school notice board. Girls, guys, if you're in a relationship that you think is going to last forever ‚Äì whether you're 15, 25 or 55 ‚Äì be aware that everybody thinks so when they're in love.  What happens afterwards is always a nasty shock.  And it's not always even when things go sour. I can remember once being appalled in a work meeting when a colleague showed off a photo of her new boyfriend's schlong that he had sent her.  She was crazy about the guy. She was showing him off. I don't know if he would have been happy for her to do so, but it's always a good idea to remember that other people don't have the same mental privacy settings as you do.  A breach of trust  The second scenario is slightly more sinister. Girls (or boys) strip for fun in online video chats with strangers. Right there is the problem. This is not a trust relationship. The people who want to see your bits online already have something wrong with them. You can't trust their intentions beyond this point.  At best, you're showing a pervert your tits and it ends there. At worst, the pervert is going to track you down and manipulate, blackmail or harm you. Don't be an idiot.  No one deserves a breach of trust, but once you've put a naked image out there, you can't get it back. People have been embarrassed and lives have been ruined by this sort of thing. Don't let it happen to you.  Oh, and, couples, the same applies to sex tapes. Just don't do it. Or if you must, erase soon after you've got your kicks.  - Georgina Guedes is a freelance writer.

That's because just several months before South Africa showcased that she could indeed handle the world's biggest sporting event, the musician and his mangled Mini-Cooper were found in Soweto. Jub Jub and his best supporting actor  Themba Tshabalala  ploughed into a group of school children, killing four of them and leaving two seriously injured. Yesterday, the two men were  found guilty of a laundry list of offences  which include: four counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, use of drugs, racing on a public road and driving under the influence of drugs. Justice was served as a hearty seven-colour meal, but many were still not satisfied. Closure For two years the victims and the families of the victims  waited for a verdict , hoping to find what newspapers and movies like to call "closure". For two years the country was gripped by a case involving a baby-faced musician who decided to cram as many poor judgment calls in one day as he could. This one tragic day could have easily become a matric Life Orientation syllabus. So many modules came out of it. The dangers of drug abuse, celebrities and the law, being a responsible motorist, the art of forgiveness and the blame game.  Many people that I spoke to who were incredibly  angry at Jub Jub  at the beginning changed their view of him over time. The anger was replaced by sympathy. The crusade for justice to be done was replaced by "everyone makes mistakes". Justice did not only become about a person paying for their crimes but about forgiveness, thoughts of rehabilitation and glass house metaphors. † I wasn't shocked at the verdict. Six young people were mowed down that day. The people who thought the verdict was harsh would have been the very same people who, had the verdict been a favourable to the accused, would have complained at the inefficiency of our justice system. 'Could have been you' Perhaps what makes this case so unique is how it made people look at their own lives and behaviour, and if you weren't looking at your own life choices, there was definitely someone out there instructing you to. When the guilty verdict was read out, responses like "it could have so easily been me or you" were quite common. I was now being made to look at my own decisions before I could formulate an opinion on something. It was like my head was being shoved into water by a school bully. My opinion was being bullied by the standards of another's morality. Different variations of "let he who is without sin cast the first stone" made the rounds. That is a tidy one to use when you want to gag someone. That should be amended to "let he who is without sin, formulate and articulate an opinion". "Maybe only angels and baby Jesus could be truly happy that justice was served."  I'm starting to think about the whole point of having an opinion. We're able to fight amongst ourselves and whoever is able to push one person to the ground first wins that particular round. We'll go on and on like this with various debates until one person becomes so exhausted, they eventually give in to the other person‚Äôs views. Maybe having an opinion is arming yourself with the right artillery to just get you through the next battle, gain a reasonable amount of credibility, and move on to the next one.  Two sides of justice When a crime has been committed against you or someone close to you, your idea of justice could look a little different. Yes, no amount of fair court proceedings will bring your loved ones back, all that's left is the person who has been the cause of your pain, being made to suffer just a little. This Jub Jub case in particular ceased being about the merits of the case and justice taking its course but about the art of forgiveness and the various stages of sympathy one felt for the man at a particular time. Those who felt nothing for him and were glad that he was found guilty were chastised by those who felt he had made a mistake and deserved a bit of leniency. Those who felt he made a mistake were similarly raked over the coals for being a little too soft. There were very few in the middle ground. Maybe justice is about choosing a side. I need a tea break. Court adjourned. - Sibongile is a videographer, blogger and social media enthusiast who would be nothing without her thumbs.  Follow her on Twitter:  @SboshMafu . Send your comments to Sibongile
