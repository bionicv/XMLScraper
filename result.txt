     Khaya Dlanga I can‚Äôt help but think that I may have had something to do with the president‚Äôs latest wedding. Perhaps I should take responsibility to the taxpayers because you dear taxpayer will be maintaining the lifestyle of the president‚Äôs newest wife. You‚Äôre also paying for the lifestyle of his other three wives. But I would be giving myself far too much credit. Congratulations, Mr President! May your libido last long and continue to prosper! On his birthday, I wrote the following tweet: ‚ÄúHappy birthday to President Jacob Zuma. I wish him many more - wives.‚Äù President Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, at the ripe young age of 70, will be tying the knot again at the weekend in a traditional ceremony in his Nkandla homestead to his fianc√©e, Gloria Bongekile Ngema. This will be our president‚Äôs sixth wedding. Currently, he has three wives. In case you don‚Äôt know their names, let me assist you. These are their names: MaNtuli Zuma, Tobeka Madiba-Zuma and MaKhumalo Zuma. One of his wives committed suicide and the other, the most famous one of the lot, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma divorced him many years ago. Hugh Hefner‚Äôs libido has nothing on the man from Nkandla. In fact, when Hugh Hefner dreams, he dreams he died and woke up as Jacob Zuma. We have to be honest now though when it comes to these presidential marriages. His marriages are out of hand - now we have to use a second hand to count the number of marriages he has had. He is certainly becoming the Elizabeth Taylor of presidents. Although he beats Ms Taylor by the mere fact that he keeps his wives - well, generally. Of course our dear president has nothing on King Mswati of Swaziland. Apparently a video was shown of the president answering 70 questions from his daughters on his 70th birthday. In answering one of the questions, Zuma said that he would happily go on a date with Helen Zille. I want to see this happen. I think he needs a white wife. I‚Äôm sure the president does not doubt that his charms would work on the leader of the DA and Western Cape. I think Helen Zille should accept the date and tweet about it too. I also think that the president should demonstrate the diversity of our nation by marrying a white, coloured and Indian woman. Having said that, I think Helen is the perfect candidate for a white wife. Unfortunately she is taken. So it will be tough going for him if he thinks he can get her. Lindiwe Mazibuko on the other hand is the one who must be worried.† I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the president made some advances in the near future. The president will certainly try hit on her because on his birthday, when his daughters asked him what he likes in his women, he replied and said, "I like one with some body." Mazibuko should do something if she wants to avoid a potential marriage proposal coming her way. I would like to congratulate the president on his on new marriage. I bet many men want to know what his secret is. Let‚Äôs face it, getting married to a fourth wife at the ripe old age of 70 is no child‚Äôs play. The man is a legend. One of the funniest tweets I read about the president must have been from  @PriMenoe : ‚ÄúYou gotta envy our President Dr Rev Zuma. He's a Widower, Divorcee, Husband & a Fianc√© all in one‚Äù Those who have a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù problem with him getting married again, have to look at their Bibles at first. He is not running a church. The Apostle Paul in his letter to Timothy, otherwise known as 1 Timothy 3:2, says to Timothy ‚Äúan elder should have but one wife‚Äù as he instructs him on what a leader of the church should be like. Zuma does not lead a church, he leads a country. Finally, he is not breaking any laws; the constitution gives him the right to marry as many women he wants. The women he married have not been forced or coerced into doing anything. So let's relax. Besides, he's paying for his own wedding, the state isn‚Äôt. Would I marry as many women as he has? I think one mother-in-law is more than enough.  - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   ‚ÄúSpeak truth to power.‚Äù Words we have heard many times and words that the powerful often use to encourage us to demonstrate how fair and democratic they are. Yet when one dares speak truth to power he is met with a full personal verbal violence designed to discredit, disseminate and disable. The attacks are straight out of the Machiavellian school of thought. To quote from his book, The Prince: ‚ÄúMen ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared.‚Äù We have seen the response of the government and African National Congress to the words of Nedbank chairperson, Reuel Khoza‚Äôs criticism of the government, demonstrated in the way of Jimmy Manyi, and from the ANC, Gwede Mantashe. Reuel Khoza was bludgeoned and bloodied in the press in Machiavellian fashion. The bludgeoning was not just to shut him up, but to ensure that any other capitalist leader who dares speak would suffer the same fate. Unfortunately we know how cowardly capitalists are; they would rather agree with Khoza in private and nod with the government in public. The ANC never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In this case, they should have missed the opportunity by ignoring the utterances of Khoza. But it could not hold itself back, but took full advantage of its bully pulpit. The ultimate weakness of insecurity is that it is a descending spiral. It confronts those who dare disagree with the weakness of arrogance, mistaking it for strength. The weak applaud and encourage bullying as a show of strength, not knowing they have exposed their weakness. Power in South Africa is devoid of humility. Khoza had said that South Africans should hold the government to account and that the country is fast  losing the checks and balances  provided by the constitution, "putative leaders who, due to sheer incapacity to deal with the complexity of 21st century governance and leadership", could not lead. The truth is that the ANC has spoken about the need for the movement to modernise and about developing leaders who will truly represent the values of the African National Congress, not careerists who have no capacity, nor care to deal with the issues of the country, other than the fact that for them, being a comrade is a career and a path towards self-enrichment. The only difference is that Khoza said the same differently. And the ANC also saw him as an outsider.  I am not advocating that those in power must forever turn the other cheek when criticised, nor am I suggesting that they should never defend themselves when falsehoods are spoken about them. It is the manner in which they respond that needs questioning. We have to question whether they want to see the truth as the citizens see it. If the citizens are incorrect, they ought to be corrected without having to resort to bully tactics. There is no need to respond with personal attacks like schoolgirls fighting over a guy during lunch break. A few days after Khoza‚Äôs comments about the government, Kuseni Dlamini, former CEO of Old Mutual Emerging Markets, wrote  a glowing review of the Zuma presidency  and said ‚ÄúPresident Zuma is doing an impeccable job‚Äù. The government said nothing. There were no attacks. Of course. No one in their right minds attacks someone who says something good about them. Whether one knows what is said about them is not entirely true. Our weakness as men allows us to be more accepting of flattery than truth. Truth does not mean disrespect either. For some mistake the harshness of their words as truth. If you speak the truth with the intention to hurt, you must also expect your words not to be listened to. There is an art to speaking the hard truths if one wants to be heard. It is also true that the truth remains the truth, no matter how it is spoken. And the truth does not change on account of our offense. But how we speak it is the line between being heard or being ignored and discredited. Unfortunately, power does not want truth, it wants to be flattery. Power does not want criticism, it wants praise. Regardless of how power responds to criticism, those with the means to speak truth to the powerful must continue to do so. Citizens of any country in the world have a moral obligation to be suspicious of their government. Over and above that, it is not enough to speak truth to power, but we have to question it. It is to be questioned because power is answerable to the people and has power as long as the people will it to have it. So long as the people say nothing, the more powerful and fearful power becomes and the more silent we become. Silence breeds a power that no longer serves those it is meant to serve, but serves itself for its own sake in an unending gluttonous feast. To criticise the ANC is to be an enemy of the ANC. This mindset ought to change. Some criticise it precisely because they want it to succeed because they know it can do better. Those in power must not want the truth in their own terms. We have got to speak truth to power for our own sake. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga Helen Zille has Julius Malema tendencies. She just doesn't have a Limpopo accent and thus seems to be more acceptable to some. Twice this year, and we‚Äôre only in March, she has outraged the black community over careless statements she has made. The outrage is not just restricted to blacks, but there have been white people too who found her statements unbecoming. And on both occasions, she saw nothing wrong with what she said and everything wrong with those who complained about what she said. There was a term she used: ‚ÄúProfessional black‚Äù. We got over that. A few days ago, she called people from the Eastern Cape refugees. Some of her defenders say that it was a poor choice of words. I would accept that if she had actually come out to say that and apologised for it. But she chose not to. Instead, she went down the meandering river of defending what should not be defended. Being a typical politician, she chose the path of the ordinary politician, not the one that extraordinary men and women would choose. To be humble yet strong. To apologise yet make a point. The humility index is at an all time low in politics. I was just as deeply offended by Jimmy Manyi‚Äôs comment last year when he said that there was an over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape. Helen Zille‚Äôs comment and Jimmy Manyi‚Äôs can be classified as one and the same thing. Mr Manyi tried some word gymnastics to justify what he had said and what he meant. Even aunt Helen went hard after uncle Jimmy for that statement. Yet today, she has also deployed the very same word gymnastics to justify and explain. I have a great deal of respect for her but the more she defends and offends, the more suspicious of her I become. She is not racist, she is an ordinary politician. She offends and then defends the offence. Thus what should not have become controversial becomes controversial. What should have been a mere ripple becomes a wave. A small thing receives unnecessary attention. She is not the first nor will she be last politician to defend a statement she knows she should not have made. Unfortunately when a politician is careless with words, the larger point that they are making is often always lost as people gleefully focus on the careless and not on the larger point. We have a flair for the dramatic and social networks are made for it. I‚Äôm afraid that she may be descending towards a re-Tony Leon-isation of her party. The political sledgehammer who never backed down from any offence he made, today he is but a footnote in the annuls of South African history. Our political discourse confuses criticism with attack and humility with weakness. She saw no need to apologise for her language, instead chose to sophisticate and go on the offense. She did not need to back down from her statement about the poor education that the Eastern Cape produces - whilst simultaneously apologising for using a denigrating word. Unfortunately the political handbook says never back down and never apologise. She reminds me of Hilary Clinton when she was running against then candidate Barack Obama for the nomination of the Democratic Party. She made a statement during one of her campaign stops where she said that when she was first lady visiting Bosnia, her plane came under gunfire and had to run to safety.  Unfortunately for her, she forgot that there were journalists on the flight. They showed footage of then first lady Hilary Clinton being greeted by children and being handed flowers on the tarmac. No gunfight anywhere. Instead of apologising for the lie, Hilary said, ‚ÄúI misspoke.‚Äù She refused to apologise. On the other hand, Obama apologised for his mistakes while campaigning. Today, Barack Obama is president and Hilary Clinton his Secretary of State. Helen Zille often speaks about the racialisation of South African politics; that the ANC wants to divide the country in black and white, and thus forever maintain a guaranteed majority. This fear probably leads her to react the way she does. That if she backs down, there will be continued racialisation and the ANC will continue to feel entitled to the black vote ‚Äì which she also needs. Yet she risks alienating some of the very same people she wants to attract to her party. Of course she won‚Äôt think that what she is doing is wrong. Her party gains support with every election and makes inroads into the black community. Thus, to her mind, her strategy is working. Although the DA should worry if Kgalema Montlathe gets the ANC presidency. But that‚Äôs a story for another day. I don‚Äôt know what it is about Helen Zille. One day she makes good points and I find myself agreeing with her. I personally have no problem with agreeing with her simply because she is the leader of the opposition. I have always found it a little short-sighted and childish of those people who refuse to agree with anything she says simply because it comes from her party. But damn, she can be out of order! Helen Zille is not racist, she‚Äôs just incredibly insensitive towards black people.  - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga One has to wonder what the government will think of making us pay for next. We are being charged for all sorts of things just nje. Our government has decided that it will make us pay for things that it is supposed to and should be paying for. Actually, it is what we are already paying for anyway, through a myriad of taxes, levies and VAT. Now we have the lovely e-toll that those of us who live in Gauteng must pay for. Instead of giving us more opportunities to make money, the government gives itself more opportunities to take money from us. A smart move would be to ensure the creation of opportunities for more people to make enough money in order to increase the taxable pool. But no, let‚Äôs make those who already pay more pay even more anyway. You have a very tiny minority paying taxes to support a large population that can‚Äôt pay taxes. It is an unsustainable practice. Of course this is not to say I don‚Äôt understand the bind the government finds itself in. The government leads a highly economically divided society, one almost sympathises with the government‚Äôs philosophy: get those who can afford to pay, to pay for those who need basic services but cannot afford to pay for them. On the one hand, you have the middle class complaining that the government is taking too much from it, thus making it a ‚Äúhave not‚Äù too. The middle class wants to help, but it does not want to feel like the government is taking from it. Surely there are other ways the government can make money other than taking from an already heavily burdened middle class. It was with great interest that I saw the middle class begin to support the activities of Cosatu. The very same people who used to look down on the marches were now hailing Vavi. The more Cosatu and Vavi target issues that weigh heavily on all South Africans, the more support Cosatu will have amongst the middle classes. If Cosatu broadens it‚Äôs scope to more than just looking after the working class, it will have a lot of popular support amongst all South Africans. Vavi has been speaking truth to power, saying things that some are afraid of saying because they are members of the ruling party. His independence has made him more popular with the middle class than the trade union he leads. He spoke out against portions of the Protection of Information Bill for example, something that the middle class was speaking against as well. It appears that Cosatu has become the voice of the people that the ANC used to be. One has to respect Vavi‚Äôs refusal to join the ANC‚Äôs NEC. He has said that his independence would be curtailed were he to become a member. We have seen how every single trade unionist has had his balls cut off as soon as they became members of the ANC‚Äôs NEC. What could the reasons be for his refusal to join the ANC‚Äôs highest structures? It is possible that he genuinely wants to stand for the people and fears being too comfortable once he shares the table of the powerful. It could also be that he wants to build a powerful moral voice that will take the ANC to task when it seems to be going against the principles of the democratic national revolution. But some in the ANC would argue that it is capable of doing that on its own; it does not need a watchdog, it is its own watchdog. There are some who argue that Vavi aspires to lead Cosatu into a political party. This is not viable. A trade union can‚Äôt be a trade union and a political party. It has to be one thing or another. Let‚Äôs continue watching this space. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga Dear African National Congress, I feel like you unfriended me on Facebook and then put it up on your status update so that everyone knows the cruel thing you have you done. You have no shame! Actually, I can even think of a worse example. It‚Äôs like we were very much in love. So in love in fact that our relationship status updates said, ‚ÄúThe African National Congress is in a relationship with Julius Malema.‚Äù Now your relationship status update says, ‚ÄúThe African National Congress is no longer in a relationship with Julius Malema.‚Äù Do you know how embarrassing this is? Everyone can see it! Plus there is that dreaded broken red heart thing there. And I simply cannot believe that there are 23 034 people who have clicked ‚Äúlike‚Äù under my broken heart! Like! They clicked the like button! They are all bloody agents! The lot of them! You bloody agents have kicked me out of your revolutionary house! Like a thing! As if I have rubbish in my trouser! Comrade Thabo Mbeki would never have done this to me! Viva Thabo Mbeki viva! I called him worse names than the Shower man while he was president, yet he did not see it fit for me to face a disciplinary hearing because he realised that we are still children who are in need of learning and schooling. Although truth be told, we actually schooled him by kicking him out of the presidency ‚Äì and look at the price I am paying now. He is still one of the best ANC presidents we have ever had. Viva president Thabo Mbeki viva! The Shower man is trying very hard to extinguish the fire in the belly of the youth. In fact, the shower is un-African because there is no word for it in Pedi It has to be said that it is rather weird that I used to say that there are no guaranteed or permanent positions in the ANC ‚Äì I used to say that as a threat to the president of the ANC. Ironically, I lost my position first! What kind of muti is that man using? Much force this one‚Äôs muthi has. Learn from him, I must. My own personal Yoda of muthi I need. I‚Äôm so bitter right now that I have a good mind to beat up those tjatjarag National Disciplinary Committee members with a plank from one of my woodwork pieces, which were somehow never appreciated. In all fairness, my woodwork results and my other marks should never have been released. However, I suspect that some agents from the West were responsible. Yes, I do have some moments of self-doubt now. Did I do the right thing? Should I have stuck to my guns? It made a lot of sense to me to be defiant because the president of this organisation once compared me to another great revolutionary, Nelson Mandela. He said that Mandela was also rebellious when he was defending me. I should have known that was a launch. But in all honesty, I am sorry, but I will never repeat this on a public platform. My life won‚Äôt be the same. You may have rejected me but I am still in love with the ANC. I know that I may seem desperate but the only thing I am desperate for is your love. Maybe I should stop blaming others for my actions.  Maybe I should take responsibility.  Maybe I should think back and re-evaluate my life.  Maybe I should apologise to those who saw potential in me, I didn‚Äôt mean to disappoint you.†  Maybe I should say sorry. Maybe I will.  Even though you have rejected me ANC, I am still in love with you. In the words of Adele: "I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded That for me it isn't over. "Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said, 'Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead'" I know I sound stalkerish and unstable but you‚Äôve got to understand that I‚Äôm hurt right now. You‚Äôre bloody agents but I still love you ANC. Love live the spirit of the ANC even though you have rejected one of your own. From Malema - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga Land is a black and white issue, but it doesn‚Äôt have a black and white solution. Then we have land issue denialism by the likes of Pieter Mulder, leader of the Freedom Front Plus, who wants to deny black people land by rewriting history. Mr Mulder clumsily tried to deny the ‚ÄúBantus‚Äù, as he called us, claim to the land in the Cape by saying there was no Bantus when the white man came. He said that ‚ÄúBantu-speaking‚Äù people had no historical claim to 40% of the land. Mr Mulder is trying to use a strategy that was applied very well by his apartheid-loving ancestors. They divided and tried to conquer us as a people. The Xhosas were not meant to like the Zulus, the Zulus must not like the Tswanas and so on and so forth. We were to be suspicious of one another so that we didn‚Äôt unite to fight. These suspicions that were so well executed with evil genius that they led to the hostel violence between the Xhosas and Zulus in the 80s and 90s during the height of the struggle. (Allow me an aside here.) My uncle, who is a priest in the Methodist church, went to these hostels to broker peace between the warring tribes. He told me that one of the most effective ways he employed to stop the fighting was by asking them one simple question. He would turn to the Zulus and ask, ‚ÄúWho amongst you has had his land stolen by the Xhosas?‚Äù There would be no answer. Then he would turn to the Xhosas and ask, ‚ÄúWho amongst you has had his land stolen from him by a Zulu?‚Äù Again, there would be no answer. And then he would say, ‚ÄúYou should not be fighting each other, but you should be uniting and fighting against those who stole your land. This is what they want you to do, to fight each other instead.‚Äù Mr Mulder is trying to decide who is South African enough, therefore dividing the black people of South Africa by saying who has greater claim to the land than the other. It is not going to happen Mr Mulder. The Zulus, Sothos, Vendas, Khoisan and other tribes all have claim to South Africa before 1652. The land belongs to them. We just didn‚Äôt have maps or title deeds. The visitors of 1652 came and claimed the land, which was not theirs, with pieces of paper, guns and laws that were not written by the original inhabitants. But I digress. Perhaps I should school Mr Mulder a little on the South African history he has so conveniently forgotten.  It was 500 years ago that the Khoisan established themselves as the dominant people in the Cape. Therefore Mr Mulder‚Äôs attempt to separate the original people‚Äôs of South Africa from the Nguni is rejected and deserves to be treated with contempt. In any case, before the 1600s, Xhosas were trading and intermarried the Khoikhoi in the Cape. Therefore the claim that ‚ÄúBantu-speaking‚Äù people had no claim to the Cape is equally rejected. Fast-forward to 1905 when the South African Native Affairs Commission recommended that certain areas be reserved only for Africans. In 1910, Parliament proposed legislation that included limits on African land ownership, which restricted blacks to only 7.5% of the land. Then in 1913, a Bill that would be known as The Natives‚Äô Land Act was passed, which restricted 68% of the population to 7.5% of the total landmass of South Africa. In 1939, Barry Hertzog increased this to 13%. The Natives‚Äô Land Act meant that blacks could only buy land from blacks. They couldn‚Äôt buy anymore land than had been restricted to them; this meant no black could buy land from a white person.  South Africa‚Äôs economy was growing and needed cheap labour. In order to force blacks to leave the rural areas to go work and service white industry, land shortage was orchestrated. With too little land to graze and forced to reduce the livestock they had and not enough land to cultivate, people had little choice but to leave their reserves and service white industry for little money.  In proposing this land restriction for labour, the South African Native Affairs Commission recommended that labour from the black reserves should always be male, single, regarded as temporarily employed in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù areas and paid at a rate mining and agriculture or country could afford.†  And I haven‚Äôt even touched on forced removals.  For a very long time, black people were not allowed to buy land outside their allocated 13% of the land even though they formed an overwhelming majority of the population. These historical imbalances are what resulted in the paltry black land ownership we find ourselves in today. There are millions of people who are alive today, who remember the forced removals, who remember being forced out of their land to make way for white people to move in. These people were moved to much smaller pieces of land ‚Äì which they could not even harvest.  Therefore we cannot continue to sweep the land issue under the carpet. It is real for many people. The land issue is important and complex. It is not something that can simply be solved by employing the same techniques the apartheid government applied. So Mr Mulder needs to sit down.†  - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga Last week‚Äôs State of the Nation Address was president Jacob Zuma‚Äôs best to date. For the. First. Time. No one was. Ma. King. Fun of. His speech making. A. bilities. It was evident that he had actually sat down and rehearsed it for hours on end. He didn‚Äôt break words he wasn‚Äôt supposed to break. Although a lot has to be said about his abilities to read Zulu. He even stopped licking his lips and hasn‚Äôt given us the finger in a very long time while fixing his glasses. For some time now, I believed that when he gave us the finger, he was subconsciously telling us what he thinks of us. Or he was saying, ‚ÄúYou ninjas are f***ed.‚Äù He was even comfortable enough to make jokes and also strayed off speech several times during the address. My favourite joke of the night was when he said that Bafana Bafana always plays but never qualifies. That brought the house down. Of course he still struggled with numbers, which surprised me. Considering the number of wives and children he has, one would have thought numbers came easily to him. At one point he even made a fat joke. I don‚Äôt think Khulubuse Zuma, his nephew, appreciated it though.  Indeed, compared to his previous speeches and to the one he gave at the ANC‚Äôs centenary celebrations, we were looking at a very comfortable president. His former rival, Thabo Mbeki, received even louder cheers than he did when he was introduced to the crowd. Why the sudden comfort, some may wonder? Well, the president no longer has to deal with his migraine, Julius Malema. It is one he created - something I addressed in a precious column called  Zuma-nkenstein‚Äôs monster . Zuma has now been forced to destroy his monster. The obliteration of Julius Malema by the Chairperson of the National Disciplinary Committee Appeal‚Äôs (NDCA), Cyril Ramaphosa, all but left him on the side of the road convulsing, left to die. The president had every reason to be comfortable. Malema appeared to have been successfully squashed, therefore, his position as president of the ANC going to Manguang was assured for the first time. It appears now that Zuma is willing to lead. He does actually want to be president. It seems he has come to realise that the job of being president is a serious matter and will be treated it as such ‚Äì now that self-preservation is no longer part of the agenda. The speech incorporated a lot of ideas proposed by the National Planning Commission chaired by Trevor Manuel. For the very first time since his presidency, there seems to be a plan for the country. It has taken him three years to get to this point. We can‚Äôt afford to have a learner president for three years though, despite the good things that came out of his speech. Since a presidential term lasts five years and a second term is not always guaranteed, three years is a very long time to learn to be president. And we do applaud him for finally getting on his job. Of course all this could be just appearances. We will wait and see. Just a few days ago, he made some disturbing statements in regards to the Constitutional Court. He wants to review its powers. Again, this is a sign of the president‚Äôs discomfort about his own position. The DA has challenged the decision by the then National Prosecution Authority head to drop the corruption charges against Zuma in court. Again, the questioning of the powers of the Constitutional Court reek of self-preservation. Will the president stop governing and concentrate on fighting another battle, the Constitutional Court?  Just as we were applauding him for finally doing his job, he goes on to say some unfortunate things regarding the judiciary. He seems to have forgotten that we live in a constitutional democracy, not an executive one. His comments clearly stated that the only logical decisions that the courts make are the one he agrees with. Mr President, lead, don‚Äôt meddle. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   It will be some time before we have an African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader that has a twang. For one, those who twang believe that being members of such organisations as the ANCYL is somehow beneath them because it is filled with non-twangers. Of course they will not say this openly. They will use all sorts of good English to justify why they do not join the league. At the end of the day, it really is a class issue. In order for the league to represent all sectors of South Africa, all sectors must participate. People must stop laughing at those who do not twang. The ability to twang does not automatically mean intelligence. For me, there is no difference between twangers and non-twangers who want to make this country great. Chances are the twanger and the non-twanger are both originally from some township. One just had the opportunity to go to a Model C school, which resulted in the ability to speak a more polished English - and possibly hit on white girls. The ideals that both people have for the country are generally similar. Both want economic freedom ‚Äì regardless of how they speak. Let us not forget that. Perhaps I should explain what a twang is for those who don‚Äôt know what it is. For a very long time, black folk (a side note to some of you News24 commentators, you may now commence and comment about how my columns are always about race even though you haven‚Äôt finished reading the column). Where was I? Oh yes, black folk.  For a long time, blacks only had access to Bantu Education and didn‚Äôt mingle with people from other races because law prohibited it. As a result, the only accents they could have were heavy traditional African accents. We didn‚Äôt spend enough time with white people for us to be able to pick their accents. Our parents spoke very correct English. But instead of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for parking,‚Äù at the shopping mall, they say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for perking.‚Äù  Then came the 90s. Nelson Mandela walked out of prison with a clenched fist and with that, we were allowed into white schools. And so, for the first time, little black girls and little black boys could mingle with little white girls and little white boys. As a result, we were able to pick up and develop a new accent. The Model C black accent.  It is not exactly white, but it is much closer to the white accent and further from the traditional black English accent. Does that make sense? If not, I‚Äôll blame it on my black accent. Yes, my fingers have an accent. As part of the first batch of black township kids who went to white schools, random strangers would ask me on the streets to speak English. Sometimes I‚Äôd have grownups from the neighbourhood coming to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù my mother when all they really wanted to do was force me to speak English because it was a miracle for them to see such a young black child speak such good English.  The Model C black accent is the newest and youngest in South Africa. It is also widely considered to be the best one to possess. It is the accent of Lindiwe Mazibuko as opposed to that of Julius Malema. You are more likely to give a favourable impression when you speak to people with your Model C accent than with a Julius one, for example. Some will assume you‚Äôre smarter simply because of your Model C accent.  It is sad because no one thinks that an Italian or Russian with a poor command of English is less intelligent, yet a black South African with a heavy Xhosa accent is somehow considered to be of questionable intelligence. All South Africans need to fix that mindset. Having said that, we still need an ANCYL president with a Model C accent in our lifetime.  If one looks at friendship circles, one will find that those circles are filled with Model C accented blacks or twangers if you wish. No non-twangers to be seen.  One of two things might happen in the future if twangers continue to shun politics. Non-twangers will control and dominate politics. The economy will be filled with twangers. But that‚Äôs a story for another day.  One can‚Äôt influence the debate from the outside. If the league is to have a twanging ANCYL president, then the twangers must join. The party is for those who want to make a difference in the future of the country. The future presidents of the ANC are already in the structures of the ANC. They have leadership positions; they are not trying to twang, they are trying to lead. And that is to be commended. On the other hand the twangers sit back and lament about the direction the country is taking. The ‚Äúwell-spoken‚Äù people need to join the ANCYL and mould it to what they want it to become. Without you, it will remain what it is.  Those who think that that the ANCYL would be less radical if it had twangers have another think coming. I know people with Model C accent who are more radical than Malema. I know that some of you are thinking that I must submarine before I parachute. Comrades, I submarine. However... Twangers of the world unite! Are-man-dler! Are-where-two! † - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   People like to say that  Nelson Mandela  is a sell-out. That he sold black people down the river. That he lived a cushy life in prison. That he turned soft in prison and decided to sell out. That he alone is to blame for the fact that black people are still talking about economic freedom today. Saying that he sold out demonstrates a lot of people‚Äôs ignorance when it comes to the history of the ANC and the negotiation process. By claiming that he ‚Äúsold out‚Äù, this crowd indirectly suggests that there was no ANC without him; that Mandela, in a miracle to rival the virgin birth, singlehandedly negotiated a free and democratic South Africa by himself. According to this heretical thinking, in the beginning was Mandela and the ANC. Through him all things were negotiated; without him, nothing that was negotiated was negotiated. These haters of  Nelson Mandela  do not realise that they have turned the man from a him into a Him. God. He is no God. As he said on the day of his release, ‚ÄúI am your servant, I am not your messiah and I am not your saviour.‚Äù Often, those who want to raise him to the level of deity always praise him alone as though there were no other people involved in the peaceful transition. Even Mandela himself has said: ‚ÄúI must not be isolated from the collective who are responsible for the success." What about those who blame Mandela for the negotiations? Perhaps a history lesson is in order.  Thabo Mbeki  led the negotiations for the ANC and his deputy was  Jacob Zuma . According to Mark Gevisser‚Äôs biography,  Thabo Mbeki : The Dream Deferred , in the first week of August 1991, while  Nelson Mandela  was in Cuba,  Thabo Mbeki  and  Jacob Zuma  were in Cambridge,  Cyril Ramaphosa  convened the ANC‚Äôs National Working Committee (NWC) while the trio were out of the country. In that meeting, Zuma was replaced as head of ANC intelligence by  Terror Lekota , ‚Äúand Mbeki had been replaced as head of negotiations, by Ramaphosa himself‚Äù. Mandela was livid upon hearing that Ramaphosa had Zuma and Mbeki replaced whilst the three of them were outside the country.  Joe Slovo  had lobbied hard to have Mbeki replaced by Ramaphosa as head of the negotiations team because he believed that ‚Äúhe was going to sell us out‚Äù. If people want to blame someone then, they should blame  Joe Slovo ‚Äôs pick, Ramaphosa. But that would be just as outlandish and insanely ridiculous as blaming Mandela for the lack of economic freedom. How can we start blaming one man? No one worked in isolation. All decisions were made by the ANC‚Äôs executive. Only lazy thinking people will blame any single individual for the way things turned out. Blame the ruling party if you want to blame someone - but they had very limited choices. ‚ÄúWhen you negotiate, you must be prepared to compromise.‚Äù  Nelson Mandela . There are some who say that he was a creation of the ANC. It is true that he was. The prisoners in Robben Island decided that he would be the one to represent their plight. In a PBS interview,  Walter Sisulu  said that Mandela was the best man to handle the situation.  Sisulu spoke about how the prison warders made the prisoners run when they were working at the quarry. According to Sisulu, one day, Mandela made a decision; it meant a great deal to all the prisoners when he suggested to them that they move slower than they ever had. That changed the situation because the warders didn‚Äôt know what to do. All of a sudden, the warders could no longer give them orders; they had to negotiate with them to get things done. That was the moment all the prisoners recognised his leadership. It was for this reason that the ANC in exile decided to make him the face of the struggle against oppression. On the ‚Äúcreation of the Mandela myth‚Äù,  Joe  Matthews said: ‚ÄúI was one of those who worked out the policy.‚Äù The people who knew him, like  Oliver Tambo , held him in high esteem.  Adelaide Tambo , Oliver‚Äôs wife, spoke about how her husband spoke about Mandela, ‚ÄúWhen Chief Luthuli was still president of the ANC, Nelson had made a speech - that speech sometimes appears on television‚Ä?. And Oliver said to me, ‚ÄòThis is the president of South Africa.‚Äô‚Äù If people like  Walter Sisulu , who knew Mdiba better than any of us ever will, can speak so glowingly about him, who are we to say some of the things we say about him? If  Oliver Tambo , the most revered man in the ANC, could point to  Nelson Mandela  while Chief Albert Luthuli was still president of the ANC, and call him the president of South Africa who are we to say some of the things we say about him? On Christmas day in exile,  Oliver Tambo  would leave an empty chair at the head of the table. He would say that chair was for the president of South Africa,  Nelson Mandela  and the other prisoners on Robben Island. If we want to talk about selling out, then we should be honest. The only people who have sold out is us. The bravest thing we do is open our mouths and blame them while we enjoy the freedom they fought for. They played their part; now fix what you‚Äôre complaining about. They have set a task for us. It is to make things increasingly perfect. As Mandela put it, ‚ÄúFreedom can never be taken for granted. Each generation must safeguard it and extend it. Your parents and elders sacrificed much so that you should have freedom without suffering what they did. Use this precious right to ensure that the darkness of the past never returns.‚Äù - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   A hundred years ago this coming week, the African National Congress was forced into being by the existence of unjust laws not fit for any being.  The right to human dignity demanded that it be born at that time. If it did not rise then, it would have at some point. History‚Äôs painful tragedy demanded it. It has lived long and prospered.  ANC, remember who you are.  When it was formed, the founders were asking for something that every human being is entitled to. Justice.  But how do you cry out for justice from the very same person who has made it his sole mission to deny you justice? How much longer could they rely on those who dealt in the worst possible pervasion of justice to give them justice?  With each passing year, the system becomes ever more so blatant in its brutality, doing everything in its power to break the spirit of the people.  You can‚Äôt break the spirit of the people when they are right. Instead, you break. In the end, the cruelty that was apartheid was broken.  Might, might be right temporarily, but never forever as the people here proved. Eventually, right becomes might and right becomes unstoppable.  Remember who you are. There are some who are looking forward to the demise of the ANC. They are Shakespeare‚Äôs Anthony. ‚ÄúI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.‚Äù  They come to bury the ANC, not to praise it today. It is true that it is not what it used to be. As if the ANC just existed for these past five, seven, ten or seventeen years since democracy.  They forget that it was here before we were. It was. Remember who you are.†  When the ANC freed the people from the deep, dark, despair of apartheid, both the prisoner and the jailer were freed.  Those who thought they were free suddenly realised that they too were prisoners. The jailers were prisoners of their fears of die swart gevaar that never materialised.  They could now go anywhere in the world without having to lie and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Zimbabwe‚Äù. They were free to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm South African,‚Äù and would be welcome anywhere in the world with great warmth.  The ANC liberated the prisoners and the jailers. Remember who you are.†  Some languished in prisons for decades. Children were born, grew up and had their own children and died while these men and women remained unbowed in prison.  Yet when they came out they had the audacity to call some of them sell-outs, as if they alone fought for the freedom. We, along with them, achieved this freedom. Foundation It is our turn to build upon the foundation they set, we couldn‚Äôt expect more from them while we do nothing. Some have refused to take responsibility and have chosen to spit in the faces of those who died and languished in prisons for us and say they did not do enough.  How dare you, you who have done nothing, call heroes names!  In fact, you can call them names if you wish, that is precisely the freedom they fought for as well. So that you can also be free to call them names without any consequence.  They were willing to die in order for you, as one famous prisoner once said, ‚ÄúIt is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to see realised. But my Lord, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."  And to quote from a column I wrote, ‚ÄúFreedom is stubborn. It never comes easily. It is not cheap. It demands sacrifices on those who pursue it.‚Äù  Still pain We have not yet healed. We are not yet united. We walk uncomfortably side by side.  The sores become visible beneath the band-aid at the slightest bump, but some of the people who have caused the injury tell you to get over it.  The nation is still in profound pain, yet it is being denied.  The ANC must find a way of healing us.  Each generation is left to create a more perfect South Africa. We can‚Äôt expect those before us to have done everything for us. If they do, what are we to contribute to history?†  At the end of Long Walk to Freedom, Nelson Mandela says, ‚ÄúAfter climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.‚Äù  The great many hills are now ours to climb. The past is built on solid foundations, we have to make a far better future.  Every day, we walk on holy ground. Sprinkled with blood. Today‚Äôs ANC and that of the future must not defile it with greed and hunger for power. The ideals of the yester-ANC were far higher.  Remember who you are ANC.  The past few years do not define the ANC. Let us not judge it with a short lens. It must be viewed with the long lens of history, all 100 years of history.  We, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ANC must strive to make the founders proud. I imagine they are smiling today and looking down saying, ‚ÄúIt is your turn now‚Äù and shouting, ‚ÄúAmandla! Ngawenu!‚Äù  In the great Vulcan greeting, ‚ÄúLive long and prosper.‚Äù And when I say that, I mean the people. In order for the ANC to achieve that, it will have to look after the people because the ANC is the people.  Without them, it is nothing.  Long live the ANC! The ANC is not dead yet. † - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga The young lady arrested for allegedly attempting to  smuggle cocaine in her dreadlocks  hasn‚Äôt even been tried in a court of law yet and has not been proven guilty. According to reports, she confessed that she was smuggling the drugs to a client in a hotel in Thailand. As much as we joked about her and the drugs in her hair, as much as we beat her up on the social networks, I am certain that she is beating herself harder than anyone of us could. Maybe the greater burden for her is not that she is in jail in a foreign land, but disappointing her parents. There are few things worse in this life than disappointing your parents. Unless they disappoint you first of course. There was nothing sadder than watching the  YouTube video of the girl  as they her led before the cameras with half her hair undone. The video is still so vivid to me, it as if it happening now. The Thai airport authorities lead her to a chair, they speak to each in what to us is a foreign language. She is bewildered. Tears stream down her face involuntarily. Her hair is being undone; she rests her hand on her forehead. The camera rolls, others click as though at the airport for a celebrity interview. Except not. But for a while, this young woman‚Äôs hair (or rather, her fake dreadlocks) will be famous.  Yes, we made fun of the story. We won‚Äôt be able to look at people with dreadlocks the same way again. What makes us think that things make us who we are? ‚ÄúI want! I want! I want!‚Äù is a parasite that has infested our very being as young people; we need to reassess what we value. Perhaps we value that which has a price tag, but the things that are truly valuable have no price tag. Like freedom. What can we learn from this? What can we take out from this? Know thyself Know thyself. If you can‚Äôt do that, at least know thy girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. None of us know what we would be prepared to do to get what we want, especially when an easy and harmless opportunity presents itself to us. When you know yourself, all temptations cease to be temptation. Everything is divided between things you will do, and things you will not do. When you know yourself, you become immune to peer pressure. When you think you know everything and have answers to everything, you do not know who you are.  (Disclaimer: I do not know everything and I have no answers) Stick to your principles Sometimes, principles are difficult to stick to, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes people will say you are being difficult when you stick to your principles. When you stick to your principles, you are not being difficult; you are sticking to your principles. Do not be desperation‚Äôs victim Never allow the illusion of desperation to cause you to make a decision you would never make. We can be so desperate for things that we become blind to our values. The desperation says that we must get what we want at all costs. Regardless of the price. Unfortunately, not realising that the price will cost us for a lifetime in the end - just for short-lived ecstasy. Things are fleeting, life is too precious. Quick Easy Money Quick easy money is often dangerous money. In the end, one pays more for money that comes too quickly and easily. There is no substitute for good old hard work.  Being a coward Being a coward has saved me from doing many things I knew I would regret later. Sometimes it is admirable to be a coward. We must be brave when it matters. Bravery for what adds no value to life is misguided. I‚Äôm sorry if this seems sanctimonious and preachy, but my heart bleeds for that young woman. It bleeds for her family. Her story has caused me think harder about my life, about how quickly it can change, without warning. This is not denying the fact that more often than not we have a hand in our own destruction. Beware of the self.  All we can do now is pray for her. Unfortunately, she may be a lesson to anyone who was thinking of doing what she did. As you can see, I cannot even bring myself to write her name. My heart goes out to her family. And to her, despite what she did.  Having said that, I won‚Äôt stop joking about dreadlocks and drugs. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga When Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, upon arriving in Washington, before his inauguration, he discovered that the papers were not kind to him at all. He took it all in his stride but his wife did not take kindly to what the papers said about her husband. Instead of being ultra-sensitive about what the papers were saying about him, Honest Abe, as he was known, simply said, ‚ÄúThe truth is, I suppose I am now public property‚Äù. I write about Zuma and his presidency because he is now public property. We gave the president a clean slate when he took office. We would give him the benefit of the doubt. I believed then as I do now that it is wrong for people to wish him to fail as president. How could people hope that his presidency fails? That is short-sighted because if he fails, so does South Africa. We have to hope the best for our leaders. But to hope is not enough. Not long after Zuma ascended to the presidency, Time magazine wrote the following about him in a cover story: ‚ÄúJacob Zuma was supposed to spell disaster for his country. But his presidency has started well. Can he deliver on that promise?‚Äù It has been two years now. Would Time Magazine write the same story now? Two years on? So far this presidency has delivered Schabir Shaik from the evil of prison. Shaik was convicted and incarcerated for corruption, a crime which the current president was heavily implicated in but never tried or convicted. This presidency has also delivered the Special Investigative Unit to Judge Willem Heath, a friend of the president who helped in ensuring that the corruption charges against him were dropped. The laws were of course bent to ensure that the charges were dropped. We forget that the NPA used illegally obtained information to drop the charges against Jacob Zuma. A sitting president was illegally wiretapped. We still don‚Äôt know whether the tapes were doctored or not. The evidence was never tested in court, but was taken as gospel by the then NPA. Let us not forget that Judge Willem Heath implied that then president Thabo Mbeki was behind the rape case against Zuma (for which he was acquitted) without an iota of evidence.  The Protection of Information Bill was passed by Parliament despite the misgivings many people have about it. Ironically, had the Bill been an Act of law during the Mbeki administration, Zuma would have had to face trial, not only for corruption, but also for having access to illegally obtained information. It would appear as though Zuma is more interested in consolidating power than running the country. He has appointed cronies. He has made sure that the obstacle that is Julius Malema is removed from his path. We need the president to apply his mind in running the country. He seems to apply his mind very well when it comes to ensuring that he remains in power. Just because the Information Bill may become law does not mean it‚Äôs just. Justice is not laws merely passed by Parliament. Allow me to quote from the good book on the issue of unjust laws: The book of Isaiah 10:1 ‚Äì 2 says † 1 Woe to those who make unjust laws,  †† to those who issue oppressive decrees,  2 to deprive the poor of their rights  †† and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people The Protection of Information Bill is unjust, and we believe that the Constitutional Court will vindicate us. However, it is not enough to simply have faith in the justice system; we have to make our voices heard. If the court decides that the law is unconstitutional, it will be yet another setback for Zuma, who was told by the courts last week that he did not apply his mind when he appointed Menzi Simelane as head of National Director of Public Prosecutions. The president has some bad advisors around him, and they cause him to be humiliated before the courts time and time again. No wonder his advisors are now advising him to reconsider how the judiciary functions. They seem to forget that South Africa is a constitutional democracy, not an executive democracy. Therefore, the supremacy of the constitution must be maintained, and the independence of the judiciary. We cannot profess to be a truly democratic country when the already powerful and privileged have added privileges before the law. We must not allow our important institutions to be tampered with simply because they do not serve the purposes of the powerful. The Scorpions have already been dissolved at the whim of the powerful (again, the courts came to our rescue and said their dissolution was unconstitutional). I would like to agree wholeheartedly with Desmond Tutu‚Äôs words when he said: ‚ÄúThere are those of them who don‚Äôt actually recognise people who are basically on their side, who are critical, not because we want to see them fail. It is precisely the opposite. It is to say we want to see you succeed and that is why we mention these things...there are those who are becoming...I would say dangerously hypersensitive.‚Äù We must choose the kind of future we want. We cannot allow politicians to dictate it for us. Too much blood was spilled to make this country what it is today. We cannot allow politicians to reverse the gains of democracy. Not whilst we still breathe. Zuma could be better for the country if he chooses to. Right now he has not made that choice. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   The friend zone is a dangerous place to find oneself in. It is virtually impossible to extricate oneself out of friend-zonism. Many na√Øve young men have willingly come into the friend-zone thinking that they can get out easily. No, my friend. Don‚Äôt fool yourself. It is an abyss so deep and dark you can‚Äôt get out. And worse, you can‚Äôt get into the deep dark place you really want to get in. What is the friend-zone, you may ask. Wikipedia describes it as: ‚ÄúThe friend-zone is a dating term describing a relation in which one partner wants to become intimate romantically while the other prefers to be just friends. It is generally regarded as not a positive development, particularly for a man. The sense is that once this has happened to a relationship, it's difficult to undo.‚Äù It is not just men who fall prey to this one-way romance field. Women too. But men are the ones who are most likely to fall victim to this na√Øve crime. It is a maximum-security prison and there is no parole. Emotional Booty Call The person who has friend-zoned you gets all the benefits while you get nada. The friend-zoned entity becomes nothing but an emotional outlet. When she has some relationship issues or likes some other guy who doesn‚Äôt like her back, she will call the friend-zonee. And the friend-zonee will listen with the most care and give some advice. The phone call will probably end with, ‚ÄúThanks friend‚Äù. The friend-zonee is always hoping that someday, the friend-zoner will see the error of her/his ways and decide that they want you after all. This is as rare as seeing Khulubuse not eating. All you will see is her moving from one relationship to another, except with you. Idiot. She will tell her friends that there is nothing going on between you, while you lie, perhaps to your friends and say, ‚ÄúI hit that.‚Äù We see you liar. We see you. I‚Äôve seen guys tell their friend-zoner that they like some other girl hoping that the friend-zonee with get jealous. Instead, she gets genuinely happy for him and starts picking out outfits for him to wear on a date. I my friends, yes, me, a whole Khaya Dlanga was once friend-zoned. I was young and na√Øve. The line that was used on me was, ‚ÄúI am in a relationship with Jesus.‚Äù I mean, what could I have said to that? I turned to her and said, ‚ÄúAt least I lost to a better man.‚Äù And thus the journey to the depths of friend-zonism began. But I managed to get out. The friend-zone is a form of romantic abuse. When people see you together they may say things like, ‚ÄúAre you two a couple?‚Äù She will laugh and say of course not. The friend-zonee will feel all warm and fuzzy about this, foolishly. She will do everything she would do with a boyfriend with you, but none of the stuff you wish she would do to you. How to get out Rule number one: Don‚Äôt even get into the friend-zone.  Stop hanging out with her so often. Hang out with her about once every two weeks, even then, not for too long.  Don‚Äôt go shopping with her: Once you start going shopping with her, especially if she started calling you friend, you are toast buddy. You essentially become the gay friend she always wanted to have who‚Äôd help her with her shopping. If she says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go shopping.‚Äù Just tell her you‚Äôre not interested and you‚Äôre not her gay friend. (Is saying gay friend offensive?)  Refuse to sleep in the same bed as her: If she says you can sleep in the same bed. Hell, refuse to sleep in the same house. While you pretend to sleep and tortured by thoughts of her in bed she is sleeping peacefully, dreaming about her boyfriend or potential boyfriend. Why put yourself through that hell? Refuse to talk about her emotional issues: When she starts talking about some emotional issues she has, stop her immediately! This is the greatest trap. You think that she is starting to trust you, so she‚Äôs opening up to you by telling you her issues. She isn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs trapping you. Tell her straight up: Tell her you‚Äôre no longer interested in being in her friend-zone. If she wants to go out, hang out, it‚Äôs fine, but none of that girly, crying, cuddly, shoppy stuff with you anymore. You‚Äôre out of there. Be out and mean it. The friend-zone is where many soldiers go to die. Don‚Äôt become friends, my friend. The friend-zone is not your friend, my friend. Be warned. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Khaya Dlanga The people need to be protected from the government; it is not the government that must protect itself from the people. A government that shields itself from the people cannot be trusted. The bill allows the government to be freer than the press. To quote Nelson Mandela, ‚ÄúA bad free press is preferable to a technically good, subservient one.‚Äù Allow me to indulge by quoting myself, ‚ÄúDemocracy demands that we always view our leaders with suspicion. In order for it to thrive, suspicion has to ever be present in order to ensure that it remains. We are not distrustful because we do not love our leaders; we are distrustful because we love democracy and freedom more.‚Äù Thomas Jefferson put it very well when he said, ‚ÄúExperience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.‚Äù By standing up and speaking out, we are ensuring that we are not perverted into tyranny. If we remain silent and agree to every measure of government, we are complicit to turning it into a tyrannical government. Again Thomas Jefferson said, ‚ÄúEvery government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories.‚Äù The point of democracy and freedom is to ensure that the freedoms of the common man are no less than those who wield power. The powerful and those close to the powerful should not be granted greater liberties. The bill in its current form favours those in power but denying information to the common man. Having said that, South Africa is still a democracy. It has not ceased to be one simply because of the passing of The Protection of Information Bill. The bill is not yet law. It can still be challenged and taken to the Constitutional Court even before President Jacob Zuma signs it into law. Though I do not have complete faith in our parliament, I have faith in our judiciary. Our Constitutional Court is one of the best in the world. Many of this court's rulings are highly regarded around the globe. ‚ÄúThe constitutional court may be a South African institution, but its reach and its audience are international. We are members of that international audience,‚Äù as a group of nine senior US law professors wrote just before the appointment of Constitutional Court Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The court is independent and makes up its own mind following the constitution of the land. In fact, according to former Constitutional Court Justice, Kate O‚ÄôRegan, of 147 cases to do with checking government legislation, 90 have been declared constitutionally invalid. This court can stand up to the government. It is sad of course that we have to rely on the Constitutional Court for protection and not on the lawmakers themselves. It is also embarrassing that more than half the cases taken to the ConCourt regarding government legislation have been considered constitutionally invalid. Therefore it is presumptuous of those who say that the Constitutional Court Justices will side with the ANC simply because they were appointed by the ANC. Just because Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng felt vilified by the press during his confirmation hearings, does not mean that he is unable to apply a sound legal mind. Besides, he is not the only justice on the bench. There are 10 other judges who decide on cases. The press have made a lot of noise about the passing of the bill. Many in the press agree that the press have not always conducted itself in the most exemplary manner, which could be one of the reasons some sections are included in the bill. The press must also realise that it is not always a victim; the press has the ability to victimise also. Having said that, the duty of the press is not to protect the rulers, rather to save them from themselves. The presumption with most people is that the bill is all bad. The bill is largely a really good one, except when it comes to four key points which were even detailed by the Nelson Mandela Centre. And they are: 1: Harmonisation with the PAIA and the limitation of the right of access to information. 2: Changes to the offences provisions should focus on the harm caused by disclosure of classified information. 3: The public-interest override must be reformulated. 4: The provisions for automatic declassification of old-order classified information are unnecessarily narrow. The truth is Parliament asked for submissions in opposition to the bill to made ages ago. The deadline came and went without submissions being made. Members of the opposition need to be blamed for not doing their jobs. They slept through out all of this. Are they really doing their jobs in Parliament? When they finally woke up, it was too late.  But a special mention has to go the arrogance of the ANC in this regard as well. The arrogance and the refusal to listen to the concerns of the citizens is appalling. And lastly, the press also woke up too late. Everyone who is meant to be a watchdog did nothing. Nothing. Until it was too late. Let‚Äôs take a look at ourselves here.  - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

   Let me jump on the Mshoza bandwagon here for a minute. For those of you who don‚Äôt know her (that would be many of you here), Mshoza had a massive hit song many years ago. It was a Kwaito song. It had to do with her liking a guy wearing a hat. Now she‚Äôs famous again. But this time for bleaching her skin. In her case it has nothing to do with the disease that Michael Jackson had which literally turned him white ‚Äì, a condition that causes depigmentation of sections of skin. It happens when melanin, which is responsible for skin pigmentation, die. The patches become bigger as one gets older on some people. Mshoza does not have this condition. It is a choice that she made. She just wanted to be light-skinned. A lot of people have issues with their appearance. Some don‚Äôt like their noses, lips, jaws or any other parts of their bodies for that matter. So they will go for plastic surgery and other body altering treatments and no one has a problem. I suppose this is the question Mshoza is asking: If people can have boob jobs, ass jobs, or any other jobs, what‚Äôs wrong with changing the complexion of her skin? What‚Äôs wrong with changing from a Kelly Roland to a yellow bone? For those of you who might not know, the term yellow bone was popularised by the cartoon series, Boondocks, and has come to mean light-skinned black person.  Since the arrival of Europeans, there has been a long held belief that if you‚Äôre a light-skinned black person you are automatically beautiful. Just as it has been thought that blonds have more fun. I suppose it is a fair question Mshoza is asking. Why allow other forms of body alteration but have a huge uproar when she alters her skin colour? No one says anything when some white folk darken their skins. Do we have issues as black people? The fundamental difference between having a boob job and changing the colour of your skin really goes to core of what black people have been fighting for. That being black is equal to any other race; that there is nothing inferior about being black. When a black person changes the colour of their skin to make it lighter, it seems to be a rejection of one‚Äôs blackness. But how can one be rejecting their blackness when they will remain black despite being light-skinned? One may erase their black on the outside, but the black inside that wants umqusho can‚Äôt be erased. There is nothing wrong with wanting to look good. There is everything wrong with thinking that you will be a better person because you look better. There is no plastic surgery for insecurity. It is good to look good. It is even better to be a good person. Having said that, we must not confuse wanting to look good with feelings of insecurity. Those two can be separate. One can simply want to look good because they want to, another may want to look good because of they want to be seen. To quote myself in my column,  Better to ugly or beautiful? : ‚ÄúOne thing that can be said about beauty is that it doesn‚Äôt last, ugly on the other hand does. Beauty is the sprinter, ugly is the marathon.‚Äù Mshoza is being vilified for doing what some people are probably too afraid to do. Why do I say this? The long held belief that light-skinned people are better looking still prevails and hasn‚Äôt gone away. One sees it on the social networks and can hear it in hip-hop.† Men are probably largely responsible for this. Therefore women want to be light-skinned because they know that they increase their chances of being hit on. So men cannot sit on their high horses and say women want to be light-skinned. Perhaps we should blame ourselves as men for this. If we build our women, we build the nation. Our women are beautiful in their shades. No shade is better or more beautiful than another. We must teach little black girls that they're beautiful so that they don't think they need to look like someone else to be liked. In fact we should teach this to all little girls. They have to grow up knowing that if people like them simply because of what they look like and nothing more, then those people are not worthy of their affections nor attention. I do not condone skin bleaching. We live in a free country though. My personal view is that bleaching one's skin is a form of self-oppression. And there is no greater oppression than self-oppression.  If you think that being lighter means you are more attractive, it's time you fixed your thinking. Being attractive makes you attractive, not the colour of your skin. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24.   David Moseley recently wrote that  white people should march  like the blacks. To quote him, ‚Äúour single greatest failing as a race; we‚Äôre just too damn content to work hard and expect results from effort. What kind of a bone-headed strategy is that? No wonder we‚Äôre not marching through the streets demanding free trips to Mauritius, extra cheese on our pizzas and the like. We‚Äôre too busy working. Fools. The lot of us.‚Äù The assumption, which is under the guise of humour, is that blacks don‚Äôt work hard and like free things. Well, I won‚Äôt lie. I like free things like most people do. I don‚Äôt think that the woman who wakes up at 03:00 in Soweto in order to catch a train so that she can get to work very far from her home at 08:00 on time is being lazy. I don‚Äôt think that the very same woman who catches the train to get home at 20:00 to cook for her kids and then get to bed by 22:00 to wake up again at 03:00 is lazy and lacks effort. She hardly sees her young children but spends most of her day with someone else‚Äôs kids. She has to make these choices so that her children get a better education despite her pathetic salary. If that is laziness then I apologise. Before we call people lazy, we have to understand their plight. I know that some will be tempted to call David Moseley a racist for penning that column; it would be a mistake. He simply has no idea how the poor live; he judges them from his privileged position. In fact, the column was meant to be funny and I appreciate that, but it lacked understanding of the plight of the poor. Despite my blackness, I don‚Äôt like marching. I dislike marching so much that I considered paying someone to march on my behalf during last week‚Äôs Economic Freedom march. I also saw it as doing my bit for unemployment in this country. If anything, I usually let my fingers do the marching on my laptop by tweeting. Perhaps this makes me a bit white too. It is clear that some people don‚Äôt understand South Africa. From the day apartheid began, there were many white people who fought in the struggle, who felt such a sense of injustice that they risked being disowned by their families and their communities because they decided to fight for right, not might. They were not fighting for the blacks, but for what was right. David Moseley is also insulting white people with his column. White people marched with the ANC and UDF in the 80s because they were fighting for what they knew was right. I could name Joe Slovo, Nadine Gordimer, Helen Suzman and many lesser-known heroes who struggled against oppression. The mistake some in the white community made was thinking that these white people were fighting for blacks and against white people. No. They were fighting against what was wrong. Today, they would be fighting against inequality, not against white people. I have said many times that black people are not fighting against white people, they are fighting against inequality. When they are tired of being unequal, they will march and will destroy anyone‚Äôs house in Sandton; it won‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a white or a black person‚Äôs house. Because it‚Äôs just the haves in Sandton and the haves are all colours. There are heroes of the struggle like Beyers Naud√©. He became a member of the Broederbond (Afrikaans, "Brotherhood" or "League of Brothers"). The Broederbond was a secret male Afrikaner organisation that sought the advancement of Afrikaner interests. It was the most powerful organisation in the country. It selected presidents, set up businesses, again, to advance the interest of one group. His father, Jozua Naud√©, was a founder and the first chairperson of the Broederbond. Beyers Naud√© could not justify the oppression of some groups, therefore left the brotherhood. Since he was a gifted theologian, he was tasked with giving Biblical justification for apartheid. After resigning from the Broedebond, he had to leave the Dutch Reformed Church. His last sermon to his congregation was, "We must show greater loyalty to God than to man". He left one of the most powerful and privileged organisations in order to fight injustice. To march ‚Äúwith the blacks‚Äù. In keeping with Beyers Naud√©‚Äôs teaching, in the fight against inequality, "We must show greater loyalty to God than to man". Right now, the divisions that we have set upon ourselves are a clear demonstration of man demonstrating greater loyalty to his own kind than to God. On August 9 1956, 20 000 women staged a march on the Union Buildings to protest against the proposed amendments to the Urban Areas Act (commonly known as the pass). These were women of all races. Therefore, it is narrow minded to view marching against injustice from a purely racial lens. South Africa belongs to all who live in it. Black and white. We have to work together to make what is wrong right. Hand in hand, black and white. But we will all have to sacrifice today if we want a better tomorrow. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24.   Why must you always write about race? Why is everything always about race, Khaya? Why can‚Äôt you write without touching race, Khaya? I get this a lot. Do you think I like writing about race? Unfortunately race confronts us everywhere we go. We do not use race as an excuse for anything. Race is thrust upon on our faces every day, yet some amongst us tell us to pretend. It is easy for the former perpetrator to say move on, forget about it, he does not want to be reminded of his sins. It is an insult to the wounded to tell them to forget about the injury, even though you are the one who caused the fatal blow in the first place. South Africa is a deeply racially polarised society. The polarisation mostly has to do with a lack of willingness for some people to understand the grievances each side faces. Apart from the aircon fights between blacks and whites in South Africa, right now, there is no greater division between the races than the discussion of economic liberation. Black people feel like they have to bend over backwards to accommodate white people, to ensure that they are comfortable, that they don‚Äôt feel unwanted. Yet for the blacks, there is a great sense of being affronted because they are not getting that respect back. There is a feeling that some white people want to pretend that things are just fine the way they are. For example, the great fallacy that many deny that they benefitted from the crime that was apartheid. There is a misconception that economic freedom is about taking from the one hand giving to the other. In this case, taking from white people and giving to black people. This is what makes all this economic freedom talk especially scary for many white people. All they are seeing when it comes to Julius Malema‚Äôs march to Pretoria is just about that. "We believe that in our country there shall be no minority, there shall be no majority. Just People." Steve Biko said this. What can we gather from Biko‚Äôs words? We can read that he does acknowledge that there will be a minority and a majority in the future South Africa he envisioned. But we will work towards a future with no minority or majority. Just people he said. What does that mean in today‚Äôs context? We have a poor majority. It is large and black. There is a rich minority. It is small and white. Now, now, let us not use the example of a few black billionaires and use that as an example of how rich black people are. Those are exceptions, not the norm. The inequalities are clear. A study by Richard Wilkinson shows the economic impact of inequality in societies. He uses Japan, Finland and Norway as examples of countries with the most equal societies. Then as an example, he uses the most unequal developed nation, like the US, Portugal and the UK and correlates social problems to these countries. He found that the greater the inequality in a society, the worse it does when it comes to life expectancy, maths and literacy, imprisonment, teenage pregnancies, murders etc. Japan, Finland and Norway fared much better than their more unequal counter parts. South Africa is one of the world‚Äôs most unequal societies. We don‚Äôt do well when it comes to maths and literacy, we have a high murder rate and in the words of Thabo Mbeki, ‚Äúand so on and so forth and stuff like that.‚Äù Having looked at Richard Wilkinson‚Äôs study convinced me even further that we need to create a more equal society if we want less crime, fewer people in prison and improve our maths scores as a country. Therefore, it is the government‚Äôs responsibility to create a more entrepreneurial friendly society across all social levels. The entrepreneur who lives in a shack must have equal access to tools that help him start a business as an entrepreneur in Sandton. Unfortunately, all the tools are biased to whoever lives in Sandton, therefore this means the gap will keep getting wider. In countries like Japan, Norway and Sweden, there is no polarisation, not because they are all the same, but because the societies are more equal. There is greater polarisation in the US, Portugal and the UK because of the greater inequality gaps in these countries. It is a matter or class if one can say. There is racial polarisation in South Africa because all the disadvantages and advantages are split along racial lines. For example, white unemployment in South Africa only sits at 7% while black unemployment is well over 30%. The fight for economic liberation is not a fight against white people. It is a fight against the government‚Äôs inaction. It is also a fight against inequalities in our society. Those with a sober mind will be able to tell that we are racially polarised because the inequality gap is also racial. The more the wealth is spread, the more equal we become, the less racially polarised we‚Äôll become. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

 Disclaimer:  News24 encourages freedom of speech and the
expression of diverse views. The views of columnists published on
News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24.   We all agree that the truth is right. The truth must be spoken, even though we don‚Äôt all agree that it must be, depending on who will lose out when it is. It always wants to come out, no matter how well-hidden it is. It shies away from being locked up. It knows that its place is in the sun, it does not care who it makes uncomfortable. It does not discriminate. The former sinner who has now become a saint cannot run from the truth from the years of sinning. The naked truth is naked. In politics, they try to dress it up, but all it wants is to be on a spread on Playboy magazine. Where does this all fit in when it comes to the Oilgate scandal? President Jacob Zuma has made a decision to release the report of the Donen Commission of Inquiry into the involvement of South Africans in the Iraq oil-for-food programme. In 2006, then president Thabo Mbeki commissioned an investigation into illegal transactions by South African individuals and companies in the United Nations oil for food programme. The programme was set up in 1995 to allow the Saddam Hussein regime to sell oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian aid without building up funds for military purposes. It was a way of helping Iraq trade but not enough for it to be a military threat. It is alleged that the Iraqi regime would demand kickbacks to approve these oil contracts. It is also alleged that Kgalema Motlanthe and Tokyo Sexwale were involved in these kickbacks with businessman Sandi Majali in order to benefit the ANC through private and government contracts. One of Sexwale‚Äôs companies is alleged to have paid kickbacks to Saddam‚Äôs regime. Then president Thabo Mbeki refused to release the Donen Commission of Inquiry‚Äôs findings, and so did Motlanthe when he became president after Mbeki was recalled. In October 2010, the Cape Argus also applied to have access to the report under the Promotion of Access to Information Act, Zuma turned down the application. This is why many find it strange that he has seen it fit to have the findings released all of a sudden. This is why many see this as Zuma‚Äôs dick move.  There are whispers that many are lining up behind Motlanthe to take over the presidency of the ANC during the ANC‚Äôs elective conference next year. Tokyo Sexwale is being spoken about as a possible deputy president. Zuma sees this as a threat to his own ambitions of having a second term. This is why many question Zuma‚Äôs sudden Damascus decision regarding the report. Yes, releasing the report is the right thing, but is the intention? The truth is always right. But the intentions of the truth teller are not always right. Releasing this report won‚Äôt work in Zuma‚Äôs favour. He should know; the ANC loves victims. Motlanthe is beloved in the ANC. This move will be seen for the dick move it is. When Zuma was a victim, he claimed that there was a conspiracy against him. The timing of the release of the report appears to be a conspiracy against people he sees as competition. It‚Äôs a case of, ‚ÄúDo unto others as it was done unto me.‚Äù Maybe Zuma is sincere in this. Many he is a changed man. Maybe he is reformed. Unfortunately for the general public it is hard to believe that he has done this purely because he believes the truth needs to come out. Many believe this is an act of self-preservation. In the final scene of the movie  The Town , Ben Affleck‚Äôs reformed bank robber character narrates these lines, ‚ÄúNo matter how much you change, you still got to pay the price for the things you've done.‚Äù In politics, someone else makes things happen so that you pay the price for the things you‚Äôve done. If the allegations contained in the report are true, Zuma wants them to pay ‚Äì not for what the report accuses them of, but for moving against him. This of course is under the guise of noble intentions. Zuma was in far greater legal trouble when he ascended to the throne. This will not prevent the implicated from ascending to the throne either. He, better than anyone else should know this.  - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

 Disclaimer:  News24 encourages freedom of speech and the
expression of diverse views. The views of columnists published on
News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24.   Many of us have heard this stereotype about Xhosas being liars. We have no idea where it began, nor from where it came. One can only speculate. It is of course an unfounded stereotype that has continued over the years unabated. Seemingly well-informed and educated people appear to believe and perpetuate this notion. For the purposes of full disclosure I suppose it is necessary that I out myself, I am Xhosa. My clan name is  uMadiba, uDlomo, uNgqolomsila, uSopitsho, uYem-Yem uVela zimbentsele; azisambentseli zoyik abelungu . And my mother is also Xhosa, and her clan name is  uS‚Äônama, uRhadu, uSomadoda, amalendelwa yintombi ithi ‚Äúndizeke noba awuna nkomo‚Äù . Now, just to make things very clear, I am not an un-fun person. I am very much fun. I make fun of myself and I make fun of others too. This is where stereotypes come in. They are part and parcel of comedy, and they are what make funny, funny. We have hundreds of them, all about our differences in this country. And they make it easy for us to laugh at others and ourselves. Nor am I pleading for an overly political correct and boring society that won‚Äôt allow us to be ourselves, and cause us to tip toe around our words. I have often wondered where the idea of Xhosas being liars might have come from. No one seems to know. This perplexes Xhosas. Those who call them liars don‚Äôt know where it comes from either. This idea is in itself a lie because it implies that only Xhosas lie and others do not. Of course other will state that what they mean is that Xhosas lie more than other tribes. I‚Äôd never heard that Xhosas had the reputation of being strangers to the truth until I moved to the big city, Johannesburg. I was shocked that these cosmopolitan people would hold such unfounded views. I remember going to a braai where the subject matter turned to Xhosas and the general agreement from those who were not Xhosa was that they‚Äôd all heard from their parents that we‚Äôre liars. What shocked me even more was the fact that there was the absolute belief that it was true. What surprised me to a point of laughter was when one the guys said that he‚Äôd heard that we are taught how to lie by our own parents. That we get taught to do this while we are still breast-feeding. Literally.  Where did this come from? I have a very uneducated theory. Of course someone may disprove it if they so wish because it is untested and un-researched. I understand that it is thin, I will boldly put it forth nonetheless. When the colonialists arrived, they first met with the San, and would then move on to the Cape. Then they met great resistance from the Xhosa during the Nine Frontier Wars (which were known as the Kaffir Wars), which were fought between 1779 to 1879. They started of as little skirmishes between the settlers and the Xhosa. So, what are the origins of this myth? Allow me to speculate. In 1820, John Brownlee founded a mission near Alice, and William Shaw established a chain of Methodist stations throughout the Transkei. These missions brought about education to the Xhosas. Some of the first schools for black people were introduced in the Cape, schools like Healdtown, which was established in 1845, and others. Of course, much later, in 1916, the formation of the now famous university of Fort Hare, which has educated the likes of Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela, Kenneth Kaunda, Robert Mugabe, Julius Nyerere amongst others. It was the first such institution to be opened to blacks on the African continent. This means that the Xhosas were some of the first to receive a Western style education in South Africa, precisely because of their close proximity to these schools. What does this mean? This is where some of you will accuse my theory of being thin. When an educated person meets a completely uneducated one (in the Western sense of the word), one can tell an uneducated person a fact, and the person who has not been exposed to that education will downright refuse to believe the evidence. Now, say you meet a person who has never seen a book, never seen a map and you say to them, ‚ÄúThe world is actually round.‚Äù The person without the education will immediately accuse you of lying, because from what they can observe, the world is flat and has mountains, its roundness is illogical. Thus the teller of this tale will be seen as a teller of tales. My theory is that the origins of the lying Xhosas stems from education, just as the aggressive Zulu stems from the era of Shaka Zulu. I have never met a Zulu that is more aggressive than a person from another tribe or race. The only people I‚Äôve met are people who are aggressive because they are aggressive, not because they are Zulu. I‚Äôve met people who lie all the time, not because they are Xhosa, but because they just lie. To perpetuate the untruth that Xhosas are liars makes the person who continues with it, a liar. - Follow Khaya on  Twitter .

News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the
views of News24.   The hug is not as simple as it seems. Nor as harmless as it appears to be. Yet there are many intricacies that involve this age-old ritual known as the hug. The awkwardness comes in many different shapes and forms. Just the other day, I wrote a tweet and it went thus: #TeamAgainAssOutAndDoublePatOnTheBackHugs. It got an unexpected reaction which told me that many people were familiar and actually hated the ass out hug. Rightfully so. I believe that it may be apt for me to introduce you to the various hugs that are available and dished out to unsuspecting victims everywhere and every day. Yes, even the most hug savvy person out there may fall into the trap of the following hugs. Read on and know your hugs. 1: The ass out hug Many men have experienced this one. And don‚Äôt start acting like the man as if you‚Äôve never encountered this one. Ladies, I know you‚Äôre all guilty of this hug. What is the ‚Äúass out hug‚Äù? Well, thank you for asking. The ass out hug is one where a member of the opposite sex hugs you while ensuring that there is the largest possible gap between both your crotches, a gap wide enough to fit in Khulubuse. The perpetrators of this hug are usually women. The primary reason for this hug from them is to ensure that the man that is being hugged doesn‚Äôt start thinking that he stands a chance, if you know what I mean. This is a cold hug and it needs to be stopped.  2: The church side hug The church side hug is fairly common amongst your evangelical Christian types. It is also known as the side-hug. In case you are not familiar with it, allow me to describe it to you. It usually involves a brother and sister in Christ. When they hug, just their shoulders touch. Maybe this hug originated from the fact that people were usually carrying a big and heavy Bible on the other side? I am merely speculating here. The purpose of this hug is to ensure there is no hint of sexual arousal taking place between the two parties greeting each other. This hug needs to stay where it belongs, church. 3: The double pat on the back hug This hug is bad when administered by a lady to man. What is the double pat on the back hug? This hug is self-explanatory, when one hugs you; they leave you an extra two, or three pats on the back. Sometimes it is also followed by an uncomfortable smile. This hug says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever get laid by me buddy.‚Äù It is the ultimate friend zone sign. 4: The awkward after first date hug.  Let me tell you a little story: He drops her off after a date. They have a brief chat in the car before coming out. He gets out of the car and runs to her side to open her door. She gets out of the car. They carry on chatting by the passenger side. There is an uncomfortable silence, which indicates that they have both run out of things to say. He is wondering how to say goodbye to her. Do I kiss her with the hug? Do I just hug her and say goodbye? Is it even appropriate to hug her? Meanwhile, she‚Äôs thinking, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a nice guy and all, but please don‚Äôt kiss me now.‚Äù Then he says goodbye. As they reach out for the hug, they each turn their faces to the same side. Their arms clash awkwardly in mid-air. Finally they hug, as he tries to kiss her cheek, he ends up kissing her hair. 5: The almost hug. The best way to explain this one is this: That awkward moment when you reach out for a hug and they grab your hand for a handshake. It‚Äôs the hug turned into a handshake. 6: The ass out, double pat on the back hug This is probably the worst hug of them all. The ass is out, and then you get the double pat on the back. Sometimes it‚Äôs also accompanied by the back rub. I also call this the Patronising hug.  7: The sexually charged hug This hug is the extremely close up hug, where one feels the other person‚Äôs crotch and the only thing preventing the hug from turning into fully blown sex are the clothes you‚Äôre both wearing. It‚Äôs usually accompanied by a pat on the ass. Or a hand sliding down to the small of the back and then touching the rear end. 8: The creepy uncle hug (for the ladies) I don‚Äôt need to delve any deeper into this one.  That is all. As you were.
